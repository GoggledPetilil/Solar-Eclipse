Gardenia Academy is up north from town!"G\xn[Giltbert]Come on, \PN! Let's become Pokemon Trainers together!"M\xn[Giltbert]What do you think of my house, \PN? I really like it a lot!"\\xn[Giltbert]Well... I guess I'd be saying that, since I've lived here my whole life..."m\xn[Giltbert]Though you kinda have as well! You used to come by so often! I'm going to miss those times."a\xn[Giltbert]Gardenia Academy looks so...big! You can see why it's a popular Trainer School."M\xn[Giltbert]It's a bit scary living near such a majestic place, hehe..."d\xn[Giltbert]This place is always sort of relaxing... It makes me feel like being at an aiport!"|\xn[Giltbert]That sense of going somewhere new... I know you haven't travelled much, \PN... but do you get what I mean?"Ö\xn[Giltbert]This house always had a bit of a different atmosphere, huh? I wonder...the kid here is around the same age as us, right?"D\xn[Giltbert]I wonder if we'll see them during our adventure..."V\xn[Giltbert]I'm going to miss everyone. It's good to see them all one more time!"ì\xn[Giltbert]I can't believe it's been so long since we were so young... Now we're both young adults!

Hiya, \PN!"\xn[\v[5]]So, what's up?"/\xn[\v[5]]Our journey has just begun, \PN!"r\xn[\v[5]]I just said bye to my mom and dad, I'm currently heading east towards Route 1. Let's meet up there!"c\xn[\v[5]]I'll see you at Route 1! Maybe let your aunt and uncle know as well that you're off!"a\xn[\v[5]]Well, I'm still hanging out in Helianthus City. I'm in front of the Gym right now."l\xn[\v[5]]But there seems to be some kinda gathering here. They're gonna talk about something, I think."C\xn[\v[5]]They haven't started yet, though. \PN, come join me!"O\xn[\v[5]]Seems like the Gym is still closed, so I'm currently in Route 2."A\xn[\v[5]]I got a new friend though! Doug! He's really cool!"ü\xn[\v[5]]We're getting some training in right now. Why not come join me? There's some woods nearby where you might be able to catch some rare Pokemon as well.":\xn[\v[5]]Oh! My Pokemon need my attention, gotta go!"Q\xn[\v[5]]The Helianthus Gym has just opened, I heard! I'm heading back now!"x\xn[\v[5]]I've heard that the gym uses lots of Psychic-Type Pokemon! That sounds pretty tough, but I'm not worried!"D\xn[\v[5]]\PN! I'll meet you there! Let's do our best together!"}\xn[\v[5]]The gym in Biytea City was closed... It'd be smarter to just move on to Route 3 and try and reach Junkar City."v\xn[\v[5]]There is a gym in Junkar City, too. We can get our next badge there and come back to Biytea City later."H\xn[\v[5]]Let's keep moving, \PN! We'll meet each other again soon!"J\xn[\v[5]]I'm feeling a lot more confident now with the Gemini Badge!"c\xn[\v[5]]So, I'm currently just heading towards Biytea City! It's south from Helianthus City!"§\xn[\v[5]]There's a gym in Biytea as well, I'm gonna try to challenge it! But if it's closed again, I think I'll just move onwards to Route 3 and go to Junkar City."Y\xn[\v[5]]I don't really want to sit around for my whole journey. Gotta keep moving!"m\xn[\v[5]]I reached Junkar City now! I heard the Gym is pretty tough, so I'll be training up at Route 4!"|\xn[\v[5]]Got to meet some new friends, so I want them to be able to stand tall alongisde everyone else in our little squad!"]\xn[\v[5]]Hey! If you're nearby, why not meet me there at Route 4? We can have a battle!"`\xn[\v[5]]Something seems to be happening in the Telgior Mines! You heard that roar, right?"d\xn[\v[5]]I dunno what's going on, but there are people and Pokemon inside! We gotta help them!"}\xn[\v[5]]Glad we took care of that berserk Mawile... I do wonder why it behaved that way. It was the only one going berserk."j\xn[\v[5]]It just doesn't make me happy thinking about it. I'll just focus on my upcoming gym battle."j\xn[\v[5]]\PN, since you already got the badge in Junkar does that mean you're going to Jadevik City?"d\xn[\v[5]]There's no gym there, but perhaps taking a detour through the woods can help you out!"9\xn[\v[5]]I just got my 2nd Gym Badge! I'm so happy!"T\xn[\v[5]]What about you, \PN? Where are you now? You must be so far ahead now!"â\xn[\v[5]]I'll probably run over to Towngor to try and catch up with you! Though, taking a short detour to Route 5 is tempting as well..."ã\xn[\v[5]]Haha, it's a struggle! I'll just try and get to Towngor as fast as I can! From there we can really go whatever direction we want!"ñ\xn[\v[5]]So after getting my 2nd badge, I decided to take a short look into Route 5. I caught a new friend there, I hope you'll get to meet him soon!"4\xn[\v[5]]\PN, you must be nearing Towngor huh?"U\xn[\v[5]]From there, you can really go just about anywhere! Huh, that rhymes..."5\xn[\v[5]]Me? Well... I'm aiming for Malum City!"U\xn[\v[5]]Maybe we'll see each other there! If you're going there too, at least!"M\xn[\v[5]]I'm on my way to Malum City now! It sure is hot around here..."u\xn[\v[5]]Oh, you need to hear this, \PN! I heard some rumors that Biytea's Gym Leader Yira is in Malum as well!"â\xn[\v[5]]She was apparently seen near Malum Volcano... I'm gonna try and ask her for a battle when I see her! I hope she's not too busy!"t\xn[\v[5]]Though, I do wonder what she's doing here... I guess even Gym Leaders need to get out every so often!"X\xn[\v[5]]Hey! I got my 3rd Gym Badge! Joel did so well, you should have seen him!!"G\xn[\v[5]]Gosh, I'm so proud of him! I'm glad that we're partners!"w\xn[\v[5]]Anyway, I'm planning on going back to Towngor now! You know, just rest up and decide where to head next!"I\xn[\v[5]]\PN, maybe we can meet up again! How about another battle?"O\xn[\v[5]]Me and Diana are heading towards Zimbani together now, actually!"}\xn[\v[5]]Though, I have to put in a lot of effort just to keep up with her... She doesn't give me a chance to catch up!"w\xn[\v[5]]We'll break the ice soon enough! She at least seems to respect my battle prowess, which I'm happy about."O\xn[\v[5]]\PN, are you coming with us to Zimbani City? I'll see you there!"~\xn[\v[5]]Diana and I just arrived at Zimbani City. A lot happened and... Well, it's better if I just tell you in person."S\xn[\v[5]]You're still in Zimbani, right? I'm there as well, so let's meet up!"V\xn[\v[5]]Diana and I are investigating the Dragon Tomb together. It's so spooky!"S\xn[\v[5]]What are you doing, \PN? Did you receive the Zimbani City badge yet?"R\xn[\v[5]]... No? You need to speak to the old Gym Leader Benjamin to get it?"Y\xn[\v[5]]I heard his family is pretty rich. They must live in a pretty big house..."H\xn[\v[5]]I hope you can get that badge! You deserve it, after all!"T\xn[\v[5]]Diana and I are waiting at Zimbani Port. Are you coming with us, \PN?"W\xn[\v[5]]We've been invited to go to Sol Island, since we're all Gym Challengers."V\xn[\v[5]]We'll be among the first ones to see Team Sol's new base of operations."-\xn[\v[5]]Let's get this over with, \PN."A\xn[\v[5]]Sol Island... Just what has Team Sol done with it?"J\xn[\v[5]]They've perverted a historical location in their own image."W\xn[\v[5]]Well, we've been invited to check it out... Let's get it over with, \PN."2\xn[\v[5]]Diana and I just finished our tour.">\xn[\v[5]]We were invited to meet with Team Sol's leader."O\xn[\v[5]]His office is such a long way up... Are you coming with us, \PN?"A\xn[\v[5]]By the way, did you hear that annoucement earlier?":\xn[\v[5]]Seems like something went horribly wrong..."Q\xn[\v[5]]Something about a subject escaping convinement and wrecking havoc?"c\xn[\v[5]]Anyway, I'm keeping you aren't I... We'll wait for you at the Team Sol boss' office."B\xn[\v[5]]I can't believe Team Sol captured the Elite Four..."_\xn[\v[5]]Those mythical Pok√©mon should be free to protect the land, not experimented on!"0\xn[\v[5]]We can still stop them, at least."j\xn[\v[5]]If we can learn more about them at the Jyeshtha Library, we can intercept Team Sol's plans."g\xn[\v[5]]Me, you, Diana... We're all working together now to stop Team Sol! So... to the library!"f\xn[\v[5]]Team Sol is planning on trying to become the Solar Monarch by participating in the SCT."a\xn[\v[5]]In the meantime, they're also working on trying to obtain Cobalion and Solgaleo..."v\xn[\v[5]]We can't let that happen, \PN! So, let's keep collecting the Gym Badges and then head to Arcadia Ruins."R\xn[\v[5]]We're going to need to work together to get back up to the surface."P\xn[\v[5]]It's so frustrating that Team Sol used Solarium on the Apostle..."*\xn[\v[5]]Come on, let's do our best!":\xn[\v[5]]We managed to calm down The Apostle, but..."`\xn[\v[5]]Team Sol is closing in on their goals. We need to head north to protect Cobalion."q\xn[\v[5]]There, we can get our 6th Gym Badge as well. So let's head to Route 16 and discuss strategy there."_\xn[\v[5]]Diana and I are investigating Praestia Cavern. How are things going on your end?"`\xn[\v[5]]It'd be best if you challenged the gym and see if the Gym Leader knows something."a\xn[\v[5]]Mount Laplaenta is going to be a harsh climb... But you're more than capable, \PN."+\xn[\v[5]]Good luck, I believe in you!"T\xn[\v[5]]Diana told me that you found Cobalion and defended him from Team Sol."M\xn[\v[5]]I imagine Cobalion must be on his way here in Praestia Cavern."b\xn[\v[5]]The place is filled with illusions, even with Diana taking the lead it's difficult."C\xn[\v[5]]\PN, if you could help us we'd really appreciate it!"Q\xn[\v[5]]Sure! Which one of your friends did you want me to take a look at?"6\xn[\v[5]]Oh, you changed your mind? That's fine."C\xn[\v[5]]Seems like \v[3] has its heart closed shut to you..."[\xn[\v[5]]\v[3] looks almost frustrated with you... You're not getting along, are you?"i\xn[\v[5]]\v[3] seems pretty neutral on you. But that only means you can become even better friends!"`\xn[\v[5]]\v[3] seems happier when around you. I can tell that it's getting comfy with you!"u\xn[\v[5]]Wow! You and \v[3] seem so bright and cheerful together! I bet it must be a lot of fun being together!"i\xn[\v[5]]I can tell that \v[3] trusts you completely, \PN. How amazing to have such a close friend!"G\xn[\v[5]]If I had to gauge your bond, it'd be a \v[4] out of 100."V\xn[\v[5]]\PN, would you perhaps like me to say some encouraging things to \v[3]?"5\xn[\v[5]]Hey, \v[3]! Listen to me for a moment!"R\xn[\v[5]]... There! \v[3] should start to see your good side a bit more now!"(\xn[\v[5]]Oh, alright. That's fine."*\xn[\v[5]]Alright, talk to you later!"!\xn[\v[5]]Oh.

I can see that."+\xn[\v[5]]Huh, I'm the same, actually!"0\xn[\v[5]]Though, I'm a bit of a realist..."`\xn[\v[5]]I have plenty of dreams, but I wouldn't waste my time if they weren't achievable."B\xn[\v[5]]Keeping myself grounded is what keeps me sane, too."Z\xn[\v[5]]That being said, whatever dream you have, \PN... I know you can achieve it."-\xn[\v[5]]Right, I'll go study now. Bye!"U\xn[\v[5]]Have you gotten a chance to participate in the Zimbani Colosseum, \PN?"V\xn[\v[5]]I tried it once, it was super cool! It felt so fresh and new each time!"e\xn[\v[5]]I don't always get very far, but when I do I just feel like I'm the best in the world!"R\xn[\v[5]]... Of course, I'd feel even more like that if I heard it from you."8\xn[\v[5]]Hee-hee! I'm just teasing you...a little."V\xn[\v[5]]The point is, you should totally check it out! See how far you can get!"N\xn[\v[5]]Maybe I'll go do another run right now. Talk to you later, \PN!"G\xn[\v[5]]\PN, have you visited the Pok√©mon Guild in Biytea City?"H\xn[\v[5]]You can send your Pok√©mon away on adventures! It's neat!"J\xn[\v[5]]I sent some of mine once, and I got some pretty nice finds.";\xn[\v[5]]My Pok√©mon were rewarded nicely, of course!"E\xn[\v[5]]You should visit at some point if you haven't already!":\xn[\v[5]]Well, gotta run. Nice speaking to you, \PN!"]\xn[\v[5]]You know, besides being a Trainer, I really enjoy cooking and watching movies."q\xn[\v[5]]I especially love the movies from Pok√©star Studios. I'd love to visit that place myself, one day!"|\xn[\v[5]]Actually, I really enjoy traveling in general. I love seeing different cultures and meeting different people."R\xn[\v[5]]The world is so vast, you'll never know what or who you might find!"Q\xn[\v[5]]Do you have plans on traveling outside of the Solaria region, \PN?"^\xn[\v[5]]... Oops! Poken√©ct is about to run out of battery! I gotta run to a safe spot!"H\xn[\v[5]]I'm a Pok√©mon Trainer and training to be a nurse, but..."?\xn[\v[5]]Well, I'd love to try Pok√©mon Contests one day!"T\xn[\v[5]]Shame that they aren't popular in Solaria. There's so much out there."T\xn[\v[5]]I've traveled many places. I'm so grateful for all of my experiences."9\xn[\v[5]]Of course, that includes meeting you, \PN!"6\xn[\v[5]]...Oh, yikes! I just got into a battle!"%\xn[\v[5]]Let's talk later, \PN!";\xn[\v[5]]Say, \PN... What sort of movies do you like?"3\xn[\v[5]]... I see, so you like \v[1] movies?"H\xn[\v[5]]I'm actually a really big fan of Romance movies, as well."e\xn[\v[5]]Yeah, I love those kinds of movies, too! A lot of my favourite films are \v[1] movies."E\xn[\v[5]]But personally, my favourite genre are Romance movies."à\xn[\v[5]]There is just something special about two souls in such a large world, meeting by pure chance...and forming a bond together..."~\xn[\v[5]]And watching that bond grow into a lifelong friendship and watching that develop into an eternal partnership..."M\xn[\v[5]]... Sigh, I hope to find someone like that as well, one day..."<\xn[\v[5]]... Sorry. I was starting to space out there."1\xn[\v[5]]Thanks for the talk, \PN. Bye-bye!"L\xn[\v[5]]\PN, are you much of a movie watcher? Which ones do you like?")\xn[\v[5]]Oh, you like \v[1] movies?"G\xn[\v[5]]O-Oh. We're the same in that regard. Didn't expect that!"-\xn[\v[5]]\v[1] movies are really great!"3\xn[\v[5]]Though, uh... I love Romance movies."L\xn[\v[5]]I don't know what it is about them, but I enjoy them a lot..."M\xn[\v[5]]...Sorry, it's a bit embarrassing! I don't know why, though...""\xn[\v[5]]Love... seems nice."Q\xn[\v[5]]I guess you may or may not agree... but I'll leave that up to you."8\xn[\v[5]]That was interesting, at least. Bye, \PN!"p\xn[\v[5]]My friends were having a Pok√©mon battle the other day. It was nice to see them enjoy themselves."j\xn[\v[5]]They attracted a small crowd as well, even. Battles sure look different from the sidelines."h\xn[\v[5]]Then a little girl started crying, telling her mother that she wanted a Pok√©mon as well."9\xn[\v[5]]I told her to never give up on her dreams."5\xn[\v[5]]Just a few kind words goes a long way."I\xn[\v[5]]... Anyway, I think I should be on my way again. Bye, \PN!"_\xn[\v[5]]Recently, I was traveling in a remote area, without any Pok√©mon Centers nearby."R\xn[\v[5]]There was an injured Pok√©mon that a few people were worrying over."E\xn[\v[5]]The wounds seemed pretty bad. I tried my best to help."a\xn[\v[5]]Even though I'm a nurse for humans, my experience allows me to help Pok√©mon, too."=\xn[\v[5]]I hope that Pok√©mon has made a full recovery!"7\xn[\v[5]]Heh, look at the time. Bye for now, \PN."1\xn[\v[5]]\PN, what's your favourite season?"\xn[\v[5]]... \v[1], huh?"I\xn[\v[5]]I love Summer, as well! Feels like not a lot of people do!"P\xn[\v[5]]A lot of people complain about the heat, but it never bothers me."3\xn[\v[5]]I personally really like the Summer."W\xn[\v[5]]I know that people don't like the heat, but I'm personally not bothered."x\xn[\v[5]]It gives me a sense of nostalgia. It makes me think back to those lazy afternoons during summer vacation."F\xn[\v[5]]I'm also just a really big fan of ice cream, hee-hee..."C\xn[\v[5]]Maybe we can eat some ice cream together sometime..."I\xn[\v[5]]... Oh! I gotta go. A wild Pok√©mon suddenly jumped at me.".\xn[\v[5]]Talk to you soon, \PN. Bye-bye!"(\xn[\v[5]]... \v[1]... Interesting."7\xn[\v[5]]Yeah, me too! Autumn is the best season!"G\xn[\v[5]]It has the perfect balance of hot and cold. I love that!"'\xn[\v[5]]I love Autumn, actually."A\xn[\v[5]]The balance of warmth and coldness is just divine."Z\xn[\v[5]]When leaves turn warm colors, like red, yellow, and brown, it's... amazing."T\xn[\v[5]]As you can guess, Holtlant Town is a personal favorite place of mine."6\xn[\v[5]]Shall we visit there together, one day?"I\xn[\v[5]]Hehe. Think about it! For now, I need to get back to work."%\xn[\v[5]]Talk to you soon, \PN."V\xn[\v[5]]I heard that some Pok√©mon can look totally different in other regions."V\xn[\v[5]]For example... Raichu is totally different depending on where it lives."k\xn[\v[5]]Did you know that some regional variations of Dunsparce are actually incapable of evolution?"K\xn[\v[5]]Yes, I am quite the genius when it comes to Dunsparce facts."\\xn[\v[5]]For example... Did you know that Dunsparce are actually quite self-conscious?"C\xn[\v[5]]It's just so cute! They're just shy little beanbags."s\xn[\v[5]]I always make sure to pamper my Dunsparce lots and lots, to make sure that he knows that he's loved."z\xn[\v[5]]... Oops, it seems that Dunsparce overheard me and wants a bit of attention. Poor boy feels a bit left out."F\xn[\v[5]]Don't you think Ghost-type Pok√©mon are so fascinating?"Y\xn[\v[5]]I heard that there's many different types that live in the Solaria region."<\xn[\v[5]]That includes my favorite Ghost-type, Dreepy!"P\xn[\v[5]]Drakloak and Dragapult are winners in my book, too, but Dreepy..."\xn[\v[5]]It's adorable!"V\xn[\v[5]]Do you know that Dreepy love being catapulted out of Dragapult's horns?"M\xn[\v[5]]It's strange, sure, but seeing them having fun makes me smile!"G\xn[\v[5]]Speaking of which, I was gonna train my Dragapult today!"#\xn[\v[5]]Catch ya later, \PN!"=\xn[\v[5]]I love pink Pok√©mon! It's my favourite color."G\xn[\v[5]]We have a Stufful as a pet at home. She's very adorable!"X\xn[\v[5]]Whenever I see a pink Pok√©mon, I just have to resist the urge to pet it!"v\xn[\v[5]]I once fought a trainer that had a Flaaffy as his ace. I almost called off the battle entirely. Almost."0\xn[\v[5]]What's your favourite color, \PN?"L\xn[\v[5]]Ah, so you like \v[1]! Have you seen a lot of \v[1] Pok√©mon?"c\xn[\v[5]]You should totally show me a Pok√©mon that's \v[1] next time we see each other, \PN!"c\xn[\v[5]]... Oops! Gotta go. No, it's not a pink Pok√©mon. It's just more Rock-type Pok√©mon."\xn[\v[5]]Bye-bye, \PN."D\xn[\v[5]]My favourite color is green. It reminds me of nature!"8\xn[\v[5]]Dreepy is green, so that checks out, too."@\xn[\v[5]]I wear a lot of green. Maybe too much, in fact..."E\xn[\v[5]]You like \v[1]? Have you seen a lot of \v[1] Pok√©mon?"K\xn[\v[5]]Hey, why don't you show me a Pok√©mon that's \v[1] sometime!"C\xn[\v[5]]*THUD*\nOw. I just dropped my Pok√©nect on my chest."K\xn[\v[5]]Haha, that's a sign that I need to get out of bed. Bye, \PN!"^\xn[\v[5]]Time flies when I talk to you, \PN. You know what they say about time flying..."Q\xn[\v[5]]Hee-hee... It means that I'm having fun. I enjoy talking with you."k\xn[\v[5]]Feel free to give me a call and shower me with attention, I'll try to answer whenever I can."/\xn[\v[5]]Talk to you later, \PN. Bye-bye!"d\xn[\v[5]]We've had so many conversations lately, \PN... Do you ever get sick of talking to me?"T\xn[\v[5]]I don't get sick of talking to you. You're something special, haha..."O\xn[\v[5]]As long as I'm not annoying you, I'll continue to chat with you.")\xn[\v[5]]Right, gotta go. Bye, \PN!"V\xn[\v[5]]A friend asked me to help them catch Pok√©mon for their little brother."O\xn[\v[5]]What kind of Pok√©mon do you think I should catch for them, \PN?"Q\xn[\v[5]]... A \v[1]-type Pok√©mon? Yeah, maybe that could be a good one..."A\xn[\v[5]]I'll try and find a cute \v[1]-type for them then."K\xn[\v[5]]Thanks for the advice, \PN. I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye!"H\xn[\v[5]]Hey, so, I got asked this recently, and I was wondering.."M\xn[\v[5]]What kind of Pok√©mon do you think everyone should catch, \PN?"D\xn[\v[5]]... A \v[1]-type Pok√©mon? Yeah, I definitely see it!"J\xn[\v[5]]Thanks for the advice, \PN. I'll talk to you later. See ya!"\xn[\v[5]]Hey, \PN...?"P\xn[\v[5]]I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but... I just need your help."S\xn[\v[5]]I had an argument with my dad yesterday... Things got pretty heated."_\xn[\v[5]]Looking back, it feels so petty. I feel bad and want to make things up to him..."[\xn[\v[5]]... Yeah, I'll just be honest and apologize to him. I'll try and be sincere."5\xn[\v[5]]Thanks, \PN. You really cheered me up."/\xn[\v[5]]I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye."\xn[\v[5]]You up, \PN?"L\xn[\v[5]]I'm... uh... training to be a nurse... it's really hard work."R\xn[\v[5]]I keep feeling like I'm not enough. Like it's never gonna work out."c\xn[\v[5]]But I want to stop feeling like this. Because I know, deep down, I want this. A lot."X\xn[\v[5]]... Ah, you're right. I've come so far, I might as well see this through."F\xn[\v[5]]Thanks, \PN. Hearing your words helps give me strength."2\xn[\v[5]]I'm gonna rest for a bit. Bye, \PN."V\xn[\v[5]]So, \PN... What would you say is something that you work extra hard at?"O\xn[\v[5]]\v[1]? That's fair. I'd consider that pretty important, as well."E\xn[\v[5]]I actually want to work hard on my popularity as well."d\xn[\v[5]]Personally... Don't judge me for this, but... I'd want to work hard on my popularity."K\xn[\v[5]]I don't know how to explain it... I just want to be someone."m\xn[\v[5]]I know I'm already someone, yeah... But I want to feel like what I'm doing matters, I suppose."ã\xn[\v[5]]To have people recognize what I'm doing. Instead of just being...another face, I guess. Just forgotten about as soon as I'm gone."\xn[\v[5]]..."M\xn[\v[5]]...Really? I'm glad that you care, \PN. It really means a lot."R\xn[\v[5]]This got a bit heavy, hehe... I'll talk to you later, \PN. Bye-bye."G\xn[\v[5]]Hey, \PN! What's something that you work really hard at?"\xn[\v[5]]\v[1]? I see..."@\xn[\v[5]]Hahaha, same. I'm working hard on my career, too."@\xn[\v[5]]I'm actually working hard on my career right now."Q\xn[\v[5]]Of course, relationships are important. But right now, you know..."`\xn[\v[5]]My nurse training... it's what I'm working hard at. And one day, I'll be a nurse."m\xn[\v[5]]I'll have the responsibility to look after people and make sure that they are being cared for."$\xn[\v[5]]Isn't that something?"@\xn[\v[5]]...I really appreciate your support, \PN. Always."2\xn[\v[5]]Look after yourself, too, \PN. Bye."/\xn[\v[5]]Hey, I thought of something fun!"L\xn[\v[5]]Let's send each other a goofy photo, of us with our Pok√©mon!"7\xn[\v[5]]... You will? Great! Give me a moment..."T\xn[\v[5]]Aww, you and \v[1] look great together! I love the pose you're doing."p\xn[\v[5]]What do you think of Dunsparce and I? I really tried to capture my inner-Dunsparce in this photo."W\xn[\v[5]]I bet you can't even tell who is who, hee-hee. I am quite the performer."F\xn[\v[5]]That was fun, \PN. We should do it again at some point."\xn[\v[5]]Bye-bye!"$\xn[\v[5]]So, I was thinking..."F\xn[\v[5]]I'm gonna send you a pic of me with one of my Pok√©mon."&\xn[\v[5]]Will you send one back?"/\xn[\v[5]]...Yeah, awesome! Let's do this!"L\xn[\v[5]]\PN, you and \v[1] look great together! You match each other!"W\xn[\v[5]]I tried to look cool, but Dragapult ended up being the star of the show."I\xn[\v[5]]Quite frankly, I'll never be as cool as Dragapult. Hahaha!"\xn[\v[5]]See ya!"6\xn[\v[5]]Heeey, \PN... Can I ask you a question?"R\xn[\v[5]]What do you prefer? Do you care more about appearance or substance?"B\xn[\v[5]]... I see, I see... \v[1] is important to you, huh?"c\xn[\v[5]]I feel the same. I care a lot more about someone's character rather than appearance."Q\xn[\v[5]]... Well, of course appearance is also something I look at, but..."}\xn[\v[5]]I care more about learning what someone is actually like, rather than purely focus on what someone looks like."A\xn[\v[5]]Hee-hee... So, what do you think of my appearance?"v\xn[\v[5]]I'll have to make sure to put a bit more effort into my appearance then, if that's what you care about."E\xn[\v[5]]Anyway, I gotta go for now! A Trainer just spotted me."+\xn[\v[5]]\PN, something on my mind..."S\xn[\v[5]]What do you prefer? Do you care more about appearance ofr substance?"c\xn[\v[5]]IYeah. The outside may be pretty, but if there's nothing inside... what's the point?"M\xn[\v[5]]No one is truly ugly on the outside. That's what I believe in."[\xn[\v[5]]But they can be ugly on the inside. It may seem harsh, but that's the truth."7\xn[\v[5]]Hey, what do you think of my appearance?"*\xn[\v[5]]I'm quite hot, I know. Heh."@\xn[\v[5]]Alright, enough of this. I'm gonna go for a swim!"\\xn[\v[5]]...So, \PN... I hope this won't be bothersome, but I have another question..."Z\xn[\v[5]]... What do you prefer to see in people? What sort of traits do you desire?"<\xn[\v[5]]...Aha, so you respect \v[1] people the most?")\xn[\v[5]]I prefer kind people, too."(\xn[\v[5]]I prefer seeing kindness."d\xn[\v[5]]Some people might say that it's a bit boring, but I just prefer someone that is kind."^\xn[\v[5]]It takes strength to be kind and gentle. That's a sign of a truly great person.".\xn[\v[5]]I'll try to always remain kind."A\xn[\v[5]]Anyway, thanks for chatting with me, \PN. Bye-bye!"Q\xn[\v[5]]I know I've asked a lot of questions lately, but I have another..."X\xn[\v[5]]... What do you prefer to see in people? What sort of traits do you like?";\xn[\v[5]]I take it you respect \v[1] people the most?"$\xn[\v[5]]I love kind people..."O\xn[\v[5]]A kind heart... can you believe that some people don't have one?"`\xn[\v[5]]You can be nice to others on a shallow level. But it sometimes kindness can hurt.">\xn[\v[5]]Knowing that, choosing to be kind is important."6\xn[\v[5]]Anyway, thanks for the chat today, \PN!"Y\xn[\v[5]]The other day I encountered this guy and he said the weirdest thing to me."?\xn[\v[5]]He told me to listen closely and then told me..."\xn[\v[5]]"SOCIALIZER"."^\xn[\v[5]]They then told me to tell the password to the fancy guy at the Pok√©mon Center."l\xn[\v[5]]I haven't done it yet. Honestly, I actually forgot it even happened until we started talking."U\xn[\v[5]]Let's see what happens if we tell that guy the password. "SOCIALIZER"."E\xn[\v[5]]Hey! \PN! Some guy just said the weirdest thing to me."V\xn[\v[5]]Then, I was told to say that to the strange man at the Pok√©mon Center."E\xn[\v[5]]I just had to tell you, because of how strange it was."3\xn[\v[5]]Haha, anyway... catch ya later, \PN!"5\xn[\v[5]]Um... Can I ask for your opinion, \PN?"5\xn[\v[5]]Wait... Let me send you...a picture..."<\xn[\v[5]]... Do I look good? You know, in this outfit?"?\xn[\v[5]]... You think so?

I'm not trying to impress anyone!"N\xn[\v[5]]Plus, I'm normally hot and sweaty, anyway. Who would want that?"R\xn[\v[5]]... Some people would? Okay... I don't know how to respond to that."0\xn[\v[5]]Gotta get back to work. Bye, \PN!"F\xn[\v[5]]So... Um... \PN, maybe this is a weird question, but..."Y\xn[\v[5]]What sort of people do you like?

Come one, I said stop it!"6\xn[\v[5]]Sigh... You really want attention, huh."f\xn[\v[5]]Sorry, \PN. I'll have to cut it short. Dunsparce really wants some attention right now."!\xn[\v[5]]Draga!!

It helps with bonding, and stuff."N\xn[Lairus]Seems cozy enough, I suppose. But I'm glad I have my own room."q\xn[Lairus]This is where grunts do grunt work. Y'know, fill in documents and keep tracks of certain numbers."R\xn[Lairus]It's grunt work! But I guess it's still important, or something..."{\xn[Lairus]Honestly, every time I come here I just see new faces. Team Sol must hire a lot of people for this kind of work."J\xn[Lairus]Hey, that's great, right? Means more jobs for more people!"ü\xn[Lairus]I know that you're a trainer and all, so you probably don't care about this stuff right now... But perhaps in the future, you can work here as well!"r\xn[Lairus]This is the lobby for the artificial gardens. We can take the teleporters to go to different labs."L\xn[Lairus]Yeah, we got teleporters. I know, it's pretty awesome stuff."j\xn[Lairus]This place seem familiar to you? Yeah, it's all modelled after the the forests of Solaria."|\xn[Lairus]Anyway, our team do a bunch of cool stuff in here. Pok√©mon can chill out in their natural habitats. That's neat."d\xn[Lairus]Eh, whatever. Not that someone like you would care, right? Let's just get a move on."]\xn[Lairus]This place seem familiar to you? Yeah, it's all modelled after Malum Volcano."É\xn[Lairus]How they get the lava that hot without burning the whole lab down, I have no clue. And I'm not here to find out, either."ô\xn[Lairus]Speaking of which, you handled the heat back then pretty well. Battling beside bubbling hot lava... now that was a thrill I won't soon forget."`\xn[Lairus]Not that I'd like to be stuck in here. My job's cool 'cause I get to go outside."`\xn[Lairus]This place seem familiar to you? Yeah, it's all modelled after the Solarian sea."F\xn[Lairus]I think this is the research lab that Sienna works in."]\xn[Lairus]I figured it would be best to visit when everyone's done. So let's get going."e\xn[Lairus]However... I'm gonna go on ahead. Gotta make sure nothing's gonna go wrong, you know?"\xn[Lairus]Later."g\xn[Lairus]... But it might be best to go here last. I don't really feel like going here just yet."W\xn[Lairus]Yeah, I'm technically the one in charge of the tour so my say is final!"n\xn[Lairus]You know, I could get used to bossing you around. Don't you feel the same way? Now get moving!"V\xn[Lairus]This is our lord's chambers. Or at least, the hallway to his chambers."j\xn[Lairus]He'll be super... err... disappointed in us, if we disturb him now. So, let's not do that."C\xn[Lairus]Come on, turn around and get back in that elevator!"\xn[Lairus]Anyway..."2\xn[Lairus]This tour has gone on long enough."^\xn[Lairus]It's time I decide where we go and I say we're gonna visit the laboratory now!"f\xn[Sienna]This is the main lobby. You can find the reception here, as well as a Pok√©mon Center."\xn[Sienna]..."(\xn[Sienna]This is the medical bay."f\xn[Sienna]Our work can sometimes get people injured, but we make sure to take good care of them."^\xn[Sienna]I like that we have reliable healthcare workers here in case anyone gets hurt."\\xn[Sienna]They're all very good at what they do. Not to mention, it's completely free."g\xn[Sienna]The staff are paid well and the hours are very flexible... They seem satisified, to me."i\xn[Sienna]I don't frequent this place often. Neither me nor my Pok√©mon ever get seriously injured."O\xn[Sienna]...I fear that I may have digressed a little. Shall we move on?"r\xn[Sienna]We have the dorms here. High-ranking officers get the top rooms. The Grunts share the lower rooms."]\xn[Sienna]I don't like sharing a room with others. But you would have to if you joined."q\xn[Sienna]I have my own room, as I am a Team Sol admin. I spend my nights reading scientific papers online."A\xn[Sienna]...I was just thinking. \PN, do you have a dream?"è\xn[Sienna]For some reason, I can't read the look on your face. But back when I first met you, there was one thing I did feel, though: resolve."D\xn[Sienna]It makes me wonder if there's anything you dream of."!\xn[Sienna]... My own dream?"^\xn[Sienna]I have many. I appreciate that you ask but I will keep them to myself for now."=\xn[Sienna]Let's not drag our heels and proceed onwards."[\xn[Sienna]This is Aelia's room. I don't have much to say, as I don't spend time here."[\xn[Sienna]This is Lairus' room. I don't have much to say, as I don't spend time here."b\xn[Sienna]This is my room. As you can see, I have tweaked it based on my personal interests."ë\xn[Sienna]Even as I retreat here for the night, I often find myself working on things anyway. That is why I can keep track of things, even here."µ\xn[Sienna]My laptop is quite powerful. It is the most powerful laptop I've ever owned in my life. It is able to run quite a lot of high-end software and store a lot of information."®\xn[Sienna]You might assume that I am referring to video games, but I do not play those. I prefer to spend my time researching and working on personal projects instead."x\xn[Sienna]If you were to inspect my computer, you'd see a lot of documents that I assume would fly over your head."{\xn[Sienna]... That is, if you ever figure out my login details. I receive many comments on the length of my password.">\xn[Sienna]These rooms are shared among groups of grunts."E\xn[Sienna]I don't like sharing my room. I'm glad I have my own."~\xn[Sienna]This is the office where more mundane work is done, such as keeping tracks of statistics and filling out paperwork."p\xn[Sienna]These also happen to be the entry-level jobs, so it is also the biggest section of the building."\xn[Sienna]Although, it is also the most boring and mundane. I prefer the science labs, which you might have already guessed..."y\xn[Sienna]This is the lobby to the artificial habitats. We can use the teleporters to go to the different habitats."`\xn[Sienna]Is it nice here? This research garden is based on the forest regions of Solaria."|\xn[Sienna]The breeze feels almost real. This area is highly controlled to ensure the plant life will thrive here 24/7."L\xn[Sienna]The grass Pok√©mon we keep here seem happy. To me, at least."`\xn[Sienna]It's a shame that I don't work in this lab. Mine is rather dreary in comparison."^\xn[Sienna]Is it nice here? This research garden is based on the Malum region of Solaria."©\xn[Sienna]The lava is not actual lava, though it shares enough characteristics to basically be the same. There is no danger in it destroying this research lab, however."•\xn[Sienna]The Pok√©mon here live just like they would out in the wild. I wonder if they can even notice the difference. Do they realize that this is all artificial?"x\xn[Sienna]It's nice in here. Sometimes it makes me think that I'm the only one left on this planet. It's soothing."y\xn[Sienna]But at the end of the day, it's all man-made. We made this to replicate the waters that Pok√©mon live in."g\xn[Sienna]Do you like it? If you look close enough, you can see the Pok√©mon swimming underwater."C\xn[Sienna]I decided that this one would be best visited last."-\xn[Sienna]Come. Let's go deeper inside."q\xn[Sienna]I will go on ahead. It is important to make sure that everything is ready, so I will handle that."N\xn[Sienna]This is the lab. However, it is not ready yet for us to visit.")\xn[Sienna]I ask that you turn back."A\xn[Sienna]The lord's chambers are off-limits for this tour."\xn[Sienna]That aside..."P\xn[Sienna]Shall we get moving?

Gardenia Academy is up north from town!"G\xn[Giltbert]Come on, \PN! Let's become Pokemon Trainers together!"M\xn[Giltbert]What do you think of my house, \PN? I really like it a lot!"\\xn[Giltbert]Well... I guess I'd be saying that, since I've lived here my whole life..."m\xn[Giltbert]Though you kinda have as well! You used to come by so often! I'm going to miss those times."a\xn[Giltbert]Gardenia Academy looks so...big! You can see why it's a popular Trainer School."M\xn[Giltbert]It's a bit scary living near such a majestic place, hehe..."d\xn[Giltbert]This place is always sort of relaxing... It makes me feel like being at an aiport!"|\xn[Giltbert]That sense of going somewhere new... I know you haven't travelled much, \PN... but do you get what I mean?"Ö\xn[Giltbert]This house always had a bit of a different atmosphere, huh? I wonder...the kid here is around the same age as us, right?"D\xn[Giltbert]I wonder if we'll see them during our adventure..."V\xn[Giltbert]I'm going to miss everyone. It's good to see them all one more time!"ì\xn[Giltbert]I can't believe it's been so long since we were so young... Now we're both young adults!

Hiya, \PN!"\xn[\v[5]]So, what's up?"/\xn[\v[5]]Our journey has just begun, \PN!"r\xn[\v[5]]I just said bye to my mom and dad, I'm currently heading east towards Route 1. Let's meet up there!"c\xn[\v[5]]I'll see you at Route 1! Maybe let your aunt and uncle know as well that you're off!"a\xn[\v[5]]Well, I'm still hanging out in Helianthus City. I'm in front of the Gym right now."l\xn[\v[5]]But there seems to be some kinda gathering here. They're gonna talk about something, I think."C\xn[\v[5]]They haven't started yet, though. \PN, come join me!"O\xn[\v[5]]Seems like the Gym is still closed, so I'm currently in Route 2."A\xn[\v[5]]I got a new friend though! Doug! He's really cool!"ü\xn[\v[5]]We're getting some training in right now. Why not come join me? There's some woods nearby where you might be able to catch some rare Pokemon as well.":\xn[\v[5]]Oh! My Pokemon need my attention, gotta go!"Q\xn[\v[5]]The Helianthus Gym has just opened, I heard! I'm heading back now!"x\xn[\v[5]]I've heard that the gym uses lots of Psychic-Type Pokemon! That sounds pretty tough, but I'm not worried!"D\xn[\v[5]]\PN! I'll meet you there! Let's do our best together!"}\xn[\v[5]]The gym in Biytea City was closed... It'd be smarter to just move on to Route 3 and try and reach Junkar City."v\xn[\v[5]]There is a gym in Junkar City, too. We can get our next badge there and come back to Biytea City later."H\xn[\v[5]]Let's keep moving, \PN! We'll meet each other again soon!"J\xn[\v[5]]I'm feeling a lot more confident now with the Gemini Badge!"c\xn[\v[5]]So, I'm currently just heading towards Biytea City! It's south from Helianthus City!"§\xn[\v[5]]There's a gym in Biytea as well, I'm gonna try to challenge it! But if it's closed again, I think I'll just move onwards to Route 3 and go to Junkar City."Y\xn[\v[5]]I don't really want to sit around for my whole journey. Gotta keep moving!"m\xn[\v[5]]I reached Junkar City now! I heard the Gym is pretty tough, so I'll be training up at Route 4!"|\xn[\v[5]]Got to meet some new friends, so I want them to be able to stand tall alongisde everyone else in our little squad!"]\xn[\v[5]]Hey! If you're nearby, why not meet me there at Route 4? We can have a battle!"`\xn[\v[5]]Something seems to be happening in the Telgior Mines! You heard that roar, right?"d\xn[\v[5]]I dunno what's going on, but there are people and Pokemon inside! We gotta help them!"}\xn[\v[5]]Glad we took care of that berserk Mawile... I do wonder why it behaved that way. It was the only one going berserk."j\xn[\v[5]]It just doesn't make me happy thinking about it. I'll just focus on my upcoming gym battle."j\xn[\v[5]]\PN, since you already got the badge in Junkar does that mean you're going to Jadevik City?"d\xn[\v[5]]There's no gym there, but perhaps taking a detour through the woods can help you out!"9\xn[\v[5]]I just got my 2nd Gym Badge! I'm so happy!"T\xn[\v[5]]What about you, \PN? Where are you now? You must be so far ahead now!"â\xn[\v[5]]I'll probably run over to Towngor to try and catch up with you! Though, taking a short detour to Route 5 is tempting as well..."ã\xn[\v[5]]Haha, it's a struggle! I'll just try and get to Towngor as fast as I can! From there we can really go whatever direction we want!"ñ\xn[\v[5]]So after getting my 2nd badge, I decided to take a short look into Route 5. I caught a new friend there, I hope you'll get to meet him soon!"4\xn[\v[5]]\PN, you must be nearing Towngor huh?"U\xn[\v[5]]From there, you can really go just about anywhere! Huh, that rhymes..."5\xn[\v[5]]Me? Well... I'm aiming for Malum City!"U\xn[\v[5]]Maybe we'll see each other there! If you're going there too, at least!"M\xn[\v[5]]I'm on my way to Malum City now! It sure is hot around here..."u\xn[\v[5]]Oh, you need to hear this, \PN! I heard some rumors that Biytea's Gym Leader Yira is in Malum as well!"â\xn[\v[5]]She was apparently seen near Malum Volcano... I'm gonna try and ask her for a battle when I see her! I hope she's not too busy!"t\xn[\v[5]]Though, I do wonder what she's doing here... I guess even Gym Leaders need to get out every so often!"X\xn[\v[5]]Hey! I got my 3rd Gym Badge! Joel did so well, you should have seen him!!"G\xn[\v[5]]Gosh, I'm so proud of him! I'm glad that we're partners!"w\xn[\v[5]]Anyway, I'm planning on going back to Towngor now! You know, just rest up and decide where to head next!"I\xn[\v[5]]\PN, maybe we can meet up again! How about another battle?"O\xn[\v[5]]Me and Diana are heading towards Zimbani together now, actually!"}\xn[\v[5]]Though, I have to put in a lot of effort just to keep up with her... She doesn't give me a chance to catch up!"w\xn[\v[5]]We'll break the ice soon enough! She at least seems to respect my battle prowess, which I'm happy about."P\xn[\v[5]]\PN, are you coming with us to Zimbani City?  I'll see you there!"~\xn[\v[5]]Diana and I just arrived at Zimbani City. A lot happened and... Well, it's better if I just tell you in person."S\xn[\v[5]]You're still in Zimbani, right? I'm there as well, so let's meet up!"V\xn[\v[5]]Diana and I are investigating the Dragon Tomb together. It's so spooky!"S\xn[\v[5]]What are you doing, \PN? Did you receive the Zimbani City badge yet?"R\xn[\v[5]]... No? You need to speak to the old Gym Leader Benjamin to get it?"Y\xn[\v[5]]I heard his family is pretty rich. They must live in a pretty big house..."H\xn[\v[5]]I hope you can get that badge! You deserve it, after all!"T\xn[\v[5]]Diana and I are waiting at Zimbani Port. Are you coming with us, \PN?"W\xn[\v[5]]We've been invited to go to Sol Island, since we're all Gym Challengers."V\xn[\v[5]]We'll be among the first ones to see Team Sol's new base of operations."-\xn[\v[5]]Let's get this over with, \PN."A\xn[\v[5]]Sol Island... Just what has Team Sol done with it?"J\xn[\v[5]]They've perverted a historical location in their own image."W\xn[\v[5]]Well, we've been invited to check it out... Let's get it over with, \PN."2\xn[\v[5]]Diana and I just finished our tour.">\xn[\v[5]]We were invited to meet with Team Sol's leader."O\xn[\v[5]]His office is such a long way up... Are you coming with us, \PN?"A\xn[\v[5]]By the way, did you hear that annoucement earlier?":\xn[\v[5]]Seems like something went horribly wrong..."Q\xn[\v[5]]Something about a subject escaping convinement and wrecking havoc?"c\xn[\v[5]]Anyway, I'm keeping you aren't I... We'll wait for you at the Team Sol boss' office."B\xn[\v[5]]I can't believe Team Sol captured the Elite Four..."_\xn[\v[5]]Those mythical Pok√©mon should be free to protect the land, not experimented on!"0\xn[\v[5]]We can still stop them, at least."j\xn[\v[5]]If we can learn more about them at the Jyeshtha Library, we can intercept Team Sol's plans."g\xn[\v[5]]Me, you, Diana... We're all working together now to stop Team Sol! So... to the library!"f\xn[\v[5]]Team Sol is planning on trying to become the Solar Monarch by participating in the SCT."a\xn[\v[5]]In the meantime, they're also working on trying to obtain Cobalion and Solgaleo..."v\xn[\v[5]]We can't let that happen, \PN! So, let's keep collecting the Gym Badges and then head to Arcadia Ruins."R\xn[\v[5]]We're going to need to work together to get back up to the surface."P\xn[\v[5]]It's so frustrating that Team Sol used Solarium on the Apostle..."*\xn[\v[5]]Come on, let's do our best!":\xn[\v[5]]We managed to calm down The Apostle, but..."`\xn[\v[5]]Team Sol is closing in on their goals. We need to head north to protect Cobalion."q\xn[\v[5]]There, we can get our 6th Gym Badge as well. So let's head to Route 16 and discuss strategy there."_\xn[\v[5]]Diana and I are investigating Praestia Cavern. How are things going on your end?"`\xn[\v[5]]It'd be best if you challenged the gym and see if the Gym Leader knows something."a\xn[\v[5]]Mount Laplaenta is going to be a harsh climb... But you're more than capable, \PN."+\xn[\v[5]]Good luck, I believe in you!"T\xn[\v[5]]Diana told me that you found Cobalion and defended him from Team Sol."M\xn[\v[5]]I imagine Cobalion must be on his way here in Praestia Cavern."b\xn[\v[5]]The place is filled with illusions, even with Diana taking the lead it's difficult."C\xn[\v[5]]\PN, if you could help us we'd really appreciate it!"Q\xn[\v[5]]Sure! Which one of your friends did you want me to take a look at?"6\xn[\v[5]]Oh, you changed your mind? That's fine."C\xn[\v[5]]Seems like \v[3] has its heart closed shut to you..."[\xn[\v[5]]\v[3] looks almost frustrated with you... You're not getting along, are you?"i\xn[\v[5]]\v[3] seems pretty neutral on you. But that only means you can become even better friends!"`\xn[\v[5]]\v[3] seems happier when around you. I can tell that it's getting comfy with you!"u\xn[\v[5]]Wow! You and \v[3] seem so bright and cheerful together! I bet it must be a lot of fun being together!"i\xn[\v[5]]I can tell that \v[3] trusts you completely, \PN. How amazing to have such a close friend!"G\xn[\v[5]]If I had to gauge your bond, it'd be a \v[4] out of 100."V\xn[\v[5]]\PN, would you perhaps like me to say some encouraging things to \v[3]?"5\xn[\v[5]]Hey, \v[3]! Listen to me for a moment!"R\xn[\v[5]]... There! \v[3] should start to see your good side a bit more now!"(\xn[\v[5]]Oh, alright. That's fine."*\xn[\v[5]]Alright, talk to you later!"!\xn[\v[5]]Oh.

Talk to you later!"=\xn[\v[5]]Remember our conversation about our ambitions?"E\xn[\v[5]]It got me thinking. \PN, are you a dreamer or realist?"6\xn[\v[5]]You're more of a \v[1]? I can see that."+\xn[\v[5]]Huh, I'm the same, actually!"0\xn[\v[5]]Though, I'm a bit of a realist..."`\xn[\v[5]]I have plenty of dreams, but I wouldn't waste my time if they weren't achievable."B\xn[\v[5]]Keeping myself grounded is what keeps me sane, too."Z\xn[\v[5]]That being said, whatever dream you have, \PN... I know you can achieve it."-\xn[\v[5]]Right, I'll go study now. Bye!"U\xn[\v[5]]Have you gotten a chance to participate in the Zimbani Colosseum, \PN?"V\xn[\v[5]]I tried it once, it was super cool! It felt so fresh and new each time!"e\xn[\v[5]]I don't always get very far, but when I do I just feel like I'm the best in the world!"R\xn[\v[5]]... Of course, I'd feel even more like that if I heard it from you."8\xn[\v[5]]Hee-hee! I'm just teasing you...a little."V\xn[\v[5]]The point is, you should totally check it out! See how far you can get!"N\xn[\v[5]]Maybe I'll go do another run right now. Talk to you later, \PN!"G\xn[\v[5]]\PN, have you visited the Pok√©mon Guild in Biytea City?"H\xn[\v[5]]You can send your Pok√©mon away on adventures! It's neat!"J\xn[\v[5]]I sent some of mine once, and I got some pretty nice finds.";\xn[\v[5]]My Pok√©mon were rewarded nicely, of course!"E\xn[\v[5]]You should visit at some point if you haven't already!":\xn[\v[5]]Well, gotta run. Nice speaking to you, \PN!"]\xn[\v[5]]You know, besides being a Trainer, I really enjoy cooking and watching movies."q\xn[\v[5]]I especially love the movies from Pok√©star Studios. I'd love to visit that place myself, one day!"|\xn[\v[5]]Actually, I really enjoy traveling in general. I love seeing different cultures and meeting different people."R\xn[\v[5]]The world is so vast, you'll never know what or who you might find!"Q\xn[\v[5]]Do you have plans on traveling outside of the Solaria region, \PN?"^\xn[\v[5]]... Oops! Poken√©ct is about to run out of battery! I gotta run to a safe spot!"H\xn[\v[5]]I'm a Pok√©mon Trainer and training to be a nurse, but..."?\xn[\v[5]]Well, I'd love to try Pok√©mon Contests one day!"T\xn[\v[5]]Shame that they aren't popular in Solaria. There's so much out there."T\xn[\v[5]]I've traveled many places. I'm so grateful for all of my experiences."9\xn[\v[5]]Of course, that includes meeting you, \PN!"6\xn[\v[5]]...Oh, yikes! I just got into a battle!"%\xn[\v[5]]Let's talk later, \PN!";\xn[\v[5]]Say, \PN... What sort of movies do you like?"3\xn[\v[5]]... I see, so you like \v[1] movies?"H\xn[\v[5]]I'm actually a really big fan of Romance movies, as well."e\xn[\v[5]]Yeah, I love those kinds of movies, too! A lot of my favourite films are \v[1] movies."E\xn[\v[5]]But personally, my favourite genre are Romance movies."à\xn[\v[5]]There is just something special about two souls in such a large world, meeting by pure chance...and forming a bond together..."~\xn[\v[5]]And watching that bond grow into a lifelong friendship and watching that develop into an eternal partnership..."M\xn[\v[5]]... Sigh, I hope to find someone like that as well, one day..."<\xn[\v[5]]... Sorry. I was starting to space out there."1\xn[\v[5]]Thanks for the talk, \PN. Bye-bye!"L\xn[\v[5]]\PN, are you much of a movie watcher? Which ones do you like?")\xn[\v[5]]Oh, you like \v[1] movies?"G\xn[\v[5]]O-Oh. We're the same in that regard. Didn't expect that!"-\xn[\v[5]]\v[1] movies are really great!"3\xn[\v[5]]Though, uh... I love Romance movies."L\xn[\v[5]]I don't know what it is about them, but I enjoy them a lot..."M\xn[\v[5]]...Sorry, it's a bit embarrassing! I don't know why, though...""\xn[\v[5]]Love... seems nice."Q\xn[\v[5]]I guess you may or may not agree... but I'll leave that up to you."8\xn[\v[5]]That was interesting, at least. Bye, \PN!"p\xn[\v[5]]My friends were having a Pok√©mon battle the other day. It was nice to see them enjoy themselves."j\xn[\v[5]]They attracted a small crowd as well, even. Battles sure look different from the sidelines."h\xn[\v[5]]Then a little girl started crying, telling her mother that she wanted a Pok√©mon as well."9\xn[\v[5]]I told her to never give up on her dreams."5\xn[\v[5]]Just a few kind words goes a long way."I\xn[\v[5]]... Anyway, I think I should be on my way again. Bye, \PN!"_\xn[\v[5]]Recently, I was traveling in a remote area, without any Pok√©mon Centers nearby."R\xn[\v[5]]There was an injured Pok√©mon that a few people were worrying over."E\xn[\v[5]]The wounds seemed pretty bad. I tried my best to help."a\xn[\v[5]]Even though I'm a nurse for humans, my experience allows me to help Pok√©mon, too."=\xn[\v[5]]I hope that Pok√©mon has made a full recovery!"7\xn[\v[5]]Heh, look at the time. Bye for now, \PN."1\xn[\v[5]]\PN, what's your favourite season?"\xn[\v[5]]... \v[1], huh?"I\xn[\v[5]]I love Summer, as well! Feels like not a lot of people do!"P\xn[\v[5]]A lot of people complain about the heat, but it never bothers me."3\xn[\v[5]]I personally really like the Summer."W\xn[\v[5]]I know that people don't like the heat, but I'm personally not bothered."x\xn[\v[5]]It gives me a sense of nostalgia. It makes me think back to those lazy afternoons during summer vacation."F\xn[\v[5]]I'm also just a really big fan of ice cream, hee-hee..."C\xn[\v[5]]Maybe we can eat some ice cream together sometime..."I\xn[\v[5]]... Oh! I gotta go. A wild Pok√©mon suddenly jumped at me.".\xn[\v[5]]Talk to you soon, \PN. Bye-bye!"(\xn[\v[5]]... \v[1]... Interesting."7\xn[\v[5]]Yeah, me too! Autumn is the best season!"G\xn[\v[5]]It has the perfect balance of hot and cold. I love that!"'\xn[\v[5]]I love Autumn, actually."A\xn[\v[5]]The balance of warmth and coldness is just divine."Z\xn[\v[5]]When leaves turn warm colors, like red, yellow, and brown, it's... amazing."T\xn[\v[5]]As you can guess, Holtlant Town is a personal favorite place of mine."6\xn[\v[5]]Shall we visit there together, one day?"I\xn[\v[5]]Hehe. Think about it! For now, I need to get back to work."%\xn[\v[5]]Talk to you soon, \PN."V\xn[\v[5]]I heard that some Pok√©mon can look totally different in other regions."V\xn[\v[5]]For example... Raichu is totally different depending on where it lives."k\xn[\v[5]]Did you know that some regional variations of Dunsparce are actually incapable of evolution?"K\xn[\v[5]]Yes, I am quite the genius when it comes to Dunsparce facts."\\xn[\v[5]]For example... Did you know that Dunsparce are actually quite self-conscious?"C\xn[\v[5]]It's just so cute! They're just shy little beanbags."s\xn[\v[5]]I always make sure to pamper my Dunsparce lots and lots, to make sure that he knows that he's loved."z\xn[\v[5]]... Oops, it seems that Dunsparce overheard me and wants a bit of attention. Poor boy feels a bit left out."F\xn[\v[5]]Don't you think Ghost-type Pok√©mon are so fascinating?"Y\xn[\v[5]]I heard that there's many different types that live in the Solaria region."<\xn[\v[5]]That includes my favorite Ghost-type, Dreepy!"P\xn[\v[5]]Drakloak and Dragapult are winners in my book, too, but Dreepy..."\xn[\v[5]]It's adorable!"V\xn[\v[5]]Do you know that Dreepy love being catapulted out of Dragapult's horns?"M\xn[\v[5]]It's strange, sure, but seeing them having fun makes me smile!"G\xn[\v[5]]Speaking of which, I was gonna train my Dragapult today!"#\xn[\v[5]]Catch ya later, \PN!"=\xn[\v[5]]I love pink Pok√©mon! It's my favourite color."G\xn[\v[5]]We have a Stufful as a pet at home. She's very adorable!"X\xn[\v[5]]Whenever I see a pink Pok√©mon, I just have to resist the urge to pet it!"v\xn[\v[5]]I once fought a trainer that had a Flaaffy as his ace. I almost called off the battle entirely. Almost."0\xn[\v[5]]What's your favourite color, \PN?"L\xn[\v[5]]Ah, so you like \v[1]! Have you seen a lot of \v[1] Pok√©mon?"c\xn[\v[5]]You should totally show me a Pok√©mon that's \v[1] next time we see each other, \PN!"c\xn[\v[5]]... Oops! Gotta go. No, it's not a pink Pok√©mon. It's just more Rock-type Pok√©mon."\xn[\v[5]]Bye-bye, \PN."D\xn[\v[5]]My favourite color is green. It reminds me of nature!"8\xn[\v[5]]Dreepy is green, so that checks out, too."@\xn[\v[5]]I wear a lot of green. Maybe too much, in fact..."E\xn[\v[5]]You like \v[1]? Have you seen a lot of \v[1] Pok√©mon?"K\xn[\v[5]]Hey, why don't you show me a Pok√©mon that's \v[1] sometime!"C\xn[\v[5]]*THUD*\nOw. I just dropped my Pok√©nect on my chest."K\xn[\v[5]]Haha, that's a sign that I need to get out of bed. Bye, \PN!"^\xn[\v[5]]Time flies when I talk to you, \PN. You know what they say about time flying..."Q\xn[\v[5]]Hee-hee... It means that I'm having fun. I enjoy talking with you."k\xn[\v[5]]Feel free to give me a call and shower me with attention, I'll try to answer whenever I can."/\xn[\v[5]]Talk to you later, \PN. Bye-bye!"d\xn[\v[5]]We've had so many conversations lately, \PN... Do you ever get sick of talking to me?"T\xn[\v[5]]I don't get sick of talking to you. You're something special, haha..."O\xn[\v[5]]As long as I'm not annoying you, I'll continue to chat with you.")\xn[\v[5]]Right, gotta go. Bye, \PN!"V\xn[\v[5]]A friend asked me to help them catch Pok√©mon for their little brother."O\xn[\v[5]]What kind of Pok√©mon do you think I should catch for them, \PN?"Q\xn[\v[5]]... A \v[1]-type Pok√©mon? Yeah, maybe that could be a good one..."A\xn[\v[5]]I'll try and find a cute \v[1]-type for them then."K\xn[\v[5]]Thanks for the advice, \PN. I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye!"H\xn[\v[5]]Hey, so, I got asked this recently, and I was wondering.."M\xn[\v[5]]What kind of Pok√©mon do you think everyone should catch, \PN?"D\xn[\v[5]]... A \v[1]-type Pok√©mon? Yeah, I definitely see it!"J\xn[\v[5]]Thanks for the advice, \PN. I'll talk to you later. See ya!"\xn[\v[5]]Hey, \PN...?"P\xn[\v[5]]I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but... I just need your help."S\xn[\v[5]]I had an argument with my dad yesterday... Things got pretty heated."_\xn[\v[5]]Looking back, it feels so petty. I feel bad and want to make things up to him..."[\xn[\v[5]]... Yeah, I'll just be honest and apologize to him. I'll try and be sincere."5\xn[\v[5]]Thanks, \PN. You really cheered me up."/\xn[\v[5]]I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye."\xn[\v[5]]You up, \PN?"L\xn[\v[5]]I'm... uh... training to be a nurse... it's really hard work."R\xn[\v[5]]I keep feeling like I'm not enough. Like it's never gonna work out."c\xn[\v[5]]But I want to stop feeling like this. Because I know, deep down, I want this. A lot."X\xn[\v[5]]... Ah, you're right. I've come so far, I might as well see this through."F\xn[\v[5]]Thanks, \PN. Hearing your words helps give me strength."2\xn[\v[5]]I'm gonna rest for a bit. Bye, \PN."V\xn[\v[5]]So, \PN... What would you say is something that you work extra hard at?"O\xn[\v[5]]\v[1]? That's fair. I'd consider that pretty important, as well."E\xn[\v[5]]I actually want to work hard on my popularity as well."d\xn[\v[5]]Personally... Don't judge me for this, but... I'd want to work hard on my popularity."K\xn[\v[5]]I don't know how to explain it... I just want to be someone."m\xn[\v[5]]I know I'm already someone, yeah... But I want to feel like what I'm doing matters, I suppose."ã\xn[\v[5]]To have people recognize what I'm doing. Instead of just being...another face, I guess. Just forgotten about as soon as I'm gone."\xn[\v[5]]..."M\xn[\v[5]]...Really? I'm glad that you care, \PN. It really means a lot."R\xn[\v[5]]This got a bit heavy, hehe... I'll talk to you later, \PN. Bye-bye."G\xn[\v[5]]Hey, \PN! What's something that you work really hard at?"\xn[\v[5]]\v[1]? I see..."@\xn[\v[5]]Hahaha, same. I'm working hard on my career, too."@\xn[\v[5]]I'm actually working hard on my career right now."Q\xn[\v[5]]Of course, relationships are important. But right now, you know..."`\xn[\v[5]]My nurse training... it's what I'm working hard at. And one day, I'll be a nurse."m\xn[\v[5]]I'll have the responsibility to look after people and make sure that they are being cared for."$\xn[\v[5]]Isn't that something?"@\xn[\v[5]]...I really appreciate your support, \PN. Always."2\xn[\v[5]]Look after yourself, too, \PN. Bye."/\xn[\v[5]]Hey, I thought of something fun!"L\xn[\v[5]]Let's send each other a goofy photo, of us with our Pok√©mon!"7\xn[\v[5]]... You will? Great! Give me a moment..."T\xn[\v[5]]Aww, you and \v[1] look great together! I love the pose you're doing."p\xn[\v[5]]What do you think of Dunsparce and I? I really tried to capture my inner-Dunsparce in this photo."W\xn[\v[5]]I bet you can't even tell who is who, hee-hee. I am quite the performer."F\xn[\v[5]]That was fun, \PN. We should do it again at some point."\xn[\v[5]]Bye-bye!"$\xn[\v[5]]So, I was thinking..."F\xn[\v[5]]I'm gonna send you a pic of me with one of my Pok√©mon."&\xn[\v[5]]Will you send one back?"/\xn[\v[5]]...Yeah, awesome! Let's do this!"L\xn[\v[5]]\PN, you and \v[1] look great together! You match each other!"W\xn[\v[5]]I tried to look cool, but Dragapult ended up being the star of the show."I\xn[\v[5]]Quite frankly, I'll never be as cool as Dragapult. Hahaha!"\xn[\v[5]]See ya!"6\xn[\v[5]]Heeey, \PN... Can I ask you a question?"R\xn[\v[5]]What do you prefer? Do you care more about appearance or substance?"B\xn[\v[5]]... I see, I see... \v[1] is important to you, huh?"c\xn[\v[5]]I feel the same. I care a lot more about someone's character rather than appearance."Q\xn[\v[5]]... Well, of course appearance is also something I look at, but..."}\xn[\v[5]]I care more about learning what someone is actually like, rather than purely focus on what someone looks like."A\xn[\v[5]]Hee-hee... So, what do you think of my appearance?"v\xn[\v[5]]I'll have to make sure to put a bit more effort into my appearance then, if that's what you care about."E\xn[\v[5]]Anyway, I gotta go for now! A Trainer just spotted me."+\xn[\v[5]]\PN, something on my mind..."S\xn[\v[5]]What do you prefer? Do you care more about appearance ofr substance?"c\xn[\v[5]]IYeah. The outside may be pretty, but if there's nothing inside... what's the point?"M\xn[\v[5]]No one is truly ugly on the outside. That's what I believe in."[\xn[\v[5]]But they can be ugly on the inside. It may seem harsh, but that's the truth."7\xn[\v[5]]Hey, what do you think of my appearance?"*\xn[\v[5]]I'm quite hot, I know. Heh."@\xn[\v[5]]Alright, enough of this. I'm gonna go for a swim!"\\xn[\v[5]]...So, \PN... I hope this won't be bothersome, but I have another question..."Z\xn[\v[5]]... What do you prefer to see in people? What sort of traits do you desire?"<\xn[\v[5]]...Aha, so you respect \v[1] people the most?")\xn[\v[5]]I prefer kind people, too."(\xn[\v[5]]I prefer seeing kindness."d\xn[\v[5]]Some people might say that it's a bit boring, but I just prefer someone that is kind."^\xn[\v[5]]It takes strength to be kind and gentle. That's a sign of a truly great person.".\xn[\v[5]]I'll try to always remain kind."A\xn[\v[5]]Anyway, thanks for chatting with me, \PN. Bye-bye!"Q\xn[\v[5]]I know I've asked a lot of questions lately, but I have another..."X\xn[\v[5]]... What do you prefer to see in people? What sort of traits do you like?";\xn[\v[5]]I take it you respect \v[1] people the most?"$\xn[\v[5]]I love kind people..."O\xn[\v[5]]A kind heart... can you believe that some people don't have one?"`\xn[\v[5]]You can be nice to others on a shallow level. But it sometimes kindness can hurt.">\xn[\v[5]]Knowing that, choosing to be kind is important."6\xn[\v[5]]Anyway, thanks for the chat today, \PN!"Y\xn[\v[5]]The other day I encountered this guy and he said the weirdest thing to me."?\xn[\v[5]]He told me to listen closely and then told me..."\xn[\v[5]]"SOCIALIZER"."^\xn[\v[5]]They then told me to tell the password to the fancy guy at the Pok√©mon Center."l\xn[\v[5]]I haven't done it yet. Honestly, I actually forgot it even happened until we started talking."U\xn[\v[5]]Let's see what happens if we tell that guy the password. "SOCIALIZER"."E\xn[\v[5]]Hey! \PN! Some guy just said the weirdest thing to me."V\xn[\v[5]]Then, I was told to say that to the strange man at the Pok√©mon Center."E\xn[\v[5]]I just had to tell you, because of how strange it was."3\xn[\v[5]]Haha, anyway... catch ya later, \PN!"5\xn[\v[5]]Um...

I'm not trying to impress anyone!"N\xn[\v[5]]Plus, I'm normally hot and sweaty, anyway. Who would want that?"R\xn[\v[5]]... Some people would? Okay... I don't know how to respond to that."0\xn[\v[5]]Gotta get back to work. Bye, \PN!"F\xn[\v[5]]So... Um... \PN, maybe this is a weird question, but..."Y\xn[\v[5]]What sort of people do you like?

Come one, I said stop it!"6\xn[\v[5]]Sigh... You really want attention, huh."f\xn[\v[5]]Sorry, \PN. I'll have to cut it short. Dunsparce really wants some attention right now."!\xn[\v[5]]Draga!!

It helps with bonding, and stuff."N\xn[Lairus]Seems cozy enough, I suppose. But I'm glad I have my own room."q\xn[Lairus]This is where grunts do grunt work. Y'know, fill in documents and keep tracks of certain numbers."R\xn[Lairus]It's grunt work! But I guess it's still important, or something..."{\xn[Lairus]Honestly, every time I come here I just see new faces. Team Sol must hire a lot of people for this kind of work."J\xn[Lairus]Hey, that's great, right? Means more jobs for more people!"†\xn[Lairus]I know that you're a trainer and all, so you probably don't care about this stuff right now...  But perhaps in the future, you can work here as well!"s\xn[Lairus]This is the lobby for the artificial gardens.  We can take the teleporters to go to different labs."L\xn[Lairus]Yeah, we got teleporters. I know, it's pretty awesome stuff."j\xn[Lairus]This place seem familiar to you? Yeah, it's all modelled after the the forests of Solaria."|\xn[Lairus]Anyway, our team do a bunch of cool stuff in here. Pok√©mon can chill out in their natural habitats. That's neat."d\xn[Lairus]Eh, whatever. Not that someone like you would care, right? Let's just get a move on."]\xn[Lairus]This place seem familiar to you? Yeah, it's all modelled after Malum Volcano."É\xn[Lairus]How they get the lava that hot without burning the whole lab down, I have no clue. And I'm not here to find out, either."ô\xn[Lairus]Speaking of which, you handled the heat back then pretty well. Battling beside bubbling hot lava... now that was a thrill I won't soon forget."a\xn[Lairus]Not that I'd like to be stuck in here.  My job's cool 'cause I get to go outside."`\xn[Lairus]This place seem familiar to you? Yeah, it's all modelled after the Solarian sea."F\xn[Lairus]I think this is the research lab that Sienna works in."]\xn[Lairus]I figured it would be best to visit when everyone's done. So let's get going."f\xn[Lairus]However... I'm gonna go on ahead.  Gotta make sure nothing's gonna go wrong, you know?"\xn[Lairus]Later."h\xn[Lairus]... But it might be best to go here last.  I don't really feel like going here just yet."W\xn[Lairus]Yeah, I'm technically the one in charge of the tour so my say is final!"n\xn[Lairus]You know, I could get used to bossing you around. Don't you feel the same way? Now get moving!"V\xn[Lairus]This is our lord's chambers. Or at least, the hallway to his chambers."j\xn[Lairus]He'll be super... err... disappointed in us, if we disturb him now. So, let's not do that."C\xn[Lairus]Come on, turn around and get back in that elevator!"\xn[Lairus]Anyway..."2\xn[Lairus]This tour has gone on long enough."^\xn[Lairus]It's time I decide where we go and I say we're gonna visit the laboratory now!"f\xn[Sienna]This is the main lobby. You can find the reception here, as well as a Pok√©mon Center."\xn[Sienna]..."(\xn[Sienna]This is the medical bay."f\xn[Sienna]Our work can sometimes get people injured, but we make sure to take good care of them."^\xn[Sienna]I like that we have reliable healthcare workers here in case anyone gets hurt."\\xn[Sienna]They're all very good at what they do. Not to mention, it's completely free."g\xn[Sienna]The staff are paid well and the hours are very flexible... They seem satisified, to me."i\xn[Sienna]I don't frequent this place often. Neither me nor my Pok√©mon ever get seriously injured."P\xn[Sienna]...I fear that I may have digressed a little.  Shall we move on?"r\xn[Sienna]We have the dorms here. High-ranking officers get the top rooms. The Grunts share the lower rooms."^\xn[Sienna]I don't like sharing a room with others.  But you would have to if you joined."q\xn[Sienna]I have my own room, as I am a Team Sol admin. I spend my nights reading scientific papers online."A\xn[Sienna]...I was just thinking. \PN, do you have a dream?"è\xn[Sienna]For some reason, I can't read the look on your face. But back when I first met you, there was one thing I did feel, though: resolve."D\xn[Sienna]It makes me wonder if there's anything you dream of."!\xn[Sienna]... My own dream?"^\xn[Sienna]I have many. I appreciate that you ask but I will keep them to myself for now."=\xn[Sienna]Let's not drag our heels and proceed onwards."[\xn[Sienna]This is Aelia's room. I don't have much to say, as I don't spend time here."[\xn[Sienna]This is Lairus' room. I don't have much to say, as I don't spend time here."b\xn[Sienna]This is my room. As you can see, I have tweaked it based on my personal interests."ë\xn[Sienna]Even as I retreat here for the night, I often find myself working on things anyway. That is why I can keep track of things, even here."∂\xn[Sienna]My laptop is quite powerful. It is the most powerful laptop I've ever owned in my life.  It is able to run quite a lot of high-end software and store a lot of information."®\xn[Sienna]You might assume that I am referring to video games, but I do not play those. I prefer to spend my time researching and working on personal projects instead."x\xn[Sienna]If you were to inspect my computer, you'd see a lot of documents that I assume would fly over your head."{\xn[Sienna]... That is, if you ever figure out my login details. I receive many comments on the length of my password.">\xn[Sienna]These rooms are shared among groups of grunts."E\xn[Sienna]I don't like sharing my room. I'm glad I have my own."~\xn[Sienna]This is the office where more mundane work is done, such as keeping tracks of statistics and filling out paperwork."p\xn[Sienna]These also happen to be the entry-level jobs, so it is also the biggest section of the building."\xn[Sienna]Although, it is also the most boring and mundane. I prefer the science labs, which you might have already guessed..."y\xn[Sienna]This is the lobby to the artificial habitats. We can use the teleporters to go to the different habitats."`\xn[Sienna]Is it nice here? This research garden is based on the forest regions of Solaria."|\xn[Sienna]The breeze feels almost real. This area is highly controlled to ensure the plant life will thrive here 24/7."L\xn[Sienna]The grass Pok√©mon we keep here seem happy. To me, at least."`\xn[Sienna]It's a shame that I don't work in this lab. Mine is rather dreary in comparison."^\xn[Sienna]Is it nice here? This research garden is based on the Malum region of Solaria."©\xn[Sienna]The lava is not actual lava, though it shares enough characteristics to basically be the same. There is no danger in it destroying this research lab, however."•\xn[Sienna]The Pok√©mon here live just like they would out in the wild. I wonder if they can even notice the difference. Do they realize that this is all artificial?"x\xn[Sienna]It's nice in here. Sometimes it makes me think that I'm the only one left on this planet. It's soothing."z\xn[Sienna]But at the end of the day, it's all man-made.  We made this to replicate the waters that Pok√©mon live in."g\xn[Sienna]Do you like it? If you look close enough, you can see the Pok√©mon swimming underwater."C\xn[Sienna]I decided that this one would be best visited last."-\xn[Sienna]Come. Let's go deeper inside."q\xn[Sienna]I will go on ahead. It is important to make sure that everything is ready, so I will handle that."N\xn[Sienna]This is the lab. However, it is not ready yet for us to visit.")\xn[Sienna]I ask that you turn back."A\xn[Sienna]The lord's chambers are off-limits for this tour."\xn[Sienna]That aside..."P\xn[Sienna]Shall we get moving?

I know you get homesick easy."^\xn[Giltbert]When we're off, I won't be far from you at least! We can support each other!"O\xn[Giltbert]Oh, \PN are you lost? Gardenia Academy is up north from town!"G\xn[Giltbert]Come on, \PN! Let's become Pokemon Trainers together!"M\xn[Giltbert]What do you think of my house, \PN? I really like it a lot!"\\xn[Giltbert]Well... I guess I'd be saying that, since I've lived here my whole life..."m\xn[Giltbert]Though you kinda have as well! You used to come by so often! I'm going to miss those times."a\xn[Giltbert]Gardenia Academy looks so...big! You can see why it's a popular Trainer School."M\xn[Giltbert]It's a bit scary living near such a majestic place, hehe..."d\xn[Giltbert]This place is always sort of relaxing... It makes me feel like being at an aiport!"|\xn[Giltbert]That sense of going somewhere new... I know you haven't travelled much, \PN... but do you get what I mean?"Ö\xn[Giltbert]This house always had a bit of a different atmosphere, huh? I wonder...the kid here is around the same age as us, right?"D\xn[Giltbert]I wonder if we'll see them during our adventure..."V\xn[Giltbert]I'm going to miss everyone. It's good to see them all one more time!"ì\xn[Giltbert]I can't believe it's been so long since we were so young... Now we're both young adults! I don't really feel like one, to be honest..."T\xn[Giltbert]Gardenia Academy is as lively as ever. Let's get to our classroom!"2\xn[Giltbert]It's on the left side, remember?"q\xn[Giltbert]The people in Class B were all really talented as well! I wish I got to know them a bit better."E\xn[Giltbert]Let's get to our class and meet up with Xenia, \PN!"?\xn[Giltbert]We should probably hurry to the Academy, \PN!"\xn[\v[5]]Oh! Hiya, \PN!"\xn[\v[5]]So, what's up?"/\xn[\v[5]]Our journey has just begun, \PN!"r\xn[\v[5]]I just said bye to my mom and dad, I'm currently heading east towards Route 1. Let's meet up there!"c\xn[\v[5]]I'll see you at Route 1! Maybe let your aunt and uncle know as well that you're off!"a\xn[\v[5]]Well, I'm still hanging out in Helianthus City. I'm in front of the Gym right now."l\xn[\v[5]]But there seems to be some kinda gathering here. They're gonna talk about something, I think."C\xn[\v[5]]They haven't started yet, though. \PN, come join me!"O\xn[\v[5]]Seems like the Gym is still closed, so I'm currently in Route 2."A\xn[\v[5]]I got a new friend though! Doug! He's really cool!"ü\xn[\v[5]]We're getting some training in right now. Why not come join me? There's some woods nearby where you might be able to catch some rare Pokemon as well.":\xn[\v[5]]Oh! My Pokemon need my attention, gotta go!"Q\xn[\v[5]]The Helianthus Gym has just opened, I heard! I'm heading back now!"x\xn[\v[5]]I've heard that the gym uses lots of Psychic-Type Pokemon! That sounds pretty tough, but I'm not worried!"D\xn[\v[5]]\PN! I'll meet you there! Let's do our best together!"}\xn[\v[5]]The gym in Biytea City was closed... It'd be smarter to just move on to Route 3 and try and reach Junkar City."v\xn[\v[5]]There is a gym in Junkar City, too. We can get our next badge there and come back to Biytea City later."H\xn[\v[5]]Let's keep moving, \PN! We'll meet each other again soon!"J\xn[\v[5]]I'm feeling a lot more confident now with the Gemini Badge!"c\xn[\v[5]]So, I'm currently just heading towards Biytea City! It's south from Helianthus City!"§\xn[\v[5]]There's a gym in Biytea as well, I'm gonna try to challenge it! But if it's closed again, I think I'll just move onwards to Route 3 and go to Junkar City."Y\xn[\v[5]]I don't really want to sit around for my whole journey. Gotta keep moving!"m\xn[\v[5]]I reached Junkar City now! I heard the Gym is pretty tough, so I'll be training up at Route 4!"|\xn[\v[5]]Got to meet some new friends, so I want them to be able to stand tall alongisde everyone else in our little squad!"]\xn[\v[5]]Hey! If you're nearby, why not meet me there at Route 4? We can have a battle!"`\xn[\v[5]]Something seems to be happening in the Telgior Mines! You heard that roar, right?"d\xn[\v[5]]I dunno what's going on, but there are people and Pokemon inside! We gotta help them!"}\xn[\v[5]]Glad we took care of that berserk Mawile... I do wonder why it behaved that way. It was the only one going berserk."j\xn[\v[5]]It just doesn't make me happy thinking about it. I'll just focus on my upcoming gym battle."j\xn[\v[5]]\PN, since you already got the badge in Junkar does that mean you're going to Jadevik City?"d\xn[\v[5]]There's no gym there, but perhaps taking a detour through the woods can help you out!"9\xn[\v[5]]I just got my 2nd Gym Badge! I'm so happy!"T\xn[\v[5]]What about you, \PN? Where are you now? You must be so far ahead now!"â\xn[\v[5]]I'll probably run over to Towngor to try and catch up with you! Though, taking a short detour to Route 5 is tempting as well..."ã\xn[\v[5]]Haha, it's a struggle! I'll just try and get to Towngor as fast as I can! From there we can really go whatever direction we want!"ñ\xn[\v[5]]So after getting my 2nd badge, I decided to take a short look into Route 5. I caught a new friend there, I hope you'll get to meet him soon!"4\xn[\v[5]]\PN, you must be nearing Towngor huh?"U\xn[\v[5]]From there, you can really go just about anywhere! Huh, that rhymes..."5\xn[\v[5]]Me? Well... I'm aiming for Malum City!"U\xn[\v[5]]Maybe we'll see each other there! If you're going there too, at least!"M\xn[\v[5]]I'm on my way to Malum City now! It sure is hot around here..."u\xn[\v[5]]Oh, you need to hear this, \PN! I heard some rumors that Biytea's Gym Leader Yira is in Malum as well!"â\xn[\v[5]]She was apparently seen near Malum Volcano... I'm gonna try and ask her for a battle when I see her! I hope she's not too busy!"t\xn[\v[5]]Though, I do wonder what she's doing here... I guess even Gym Leaders need to get out every so often!"X\xn[\v[5]]Hey! I got my 3rd Gym Badge! Joel did so well, you should have seen him!!"G\xn[\v[5]]Gosh, I'm so proud of him! I'm glad that we're partners!"w\xn[\v[5]]Anyway, I'm planning on going back to Towngor now! You know, just rest up and decide where to head next!"I\xn[\v[5]]\PN, maybe we can meet up again! How about another battle?"O\xn[\v[5]]Me and Diana are heading towards Zimbani together now, actually!"}\xn[\v[5]]Though, I have to put in a lot of effort just to keep up with her... She doesn't give me a chance to catch up!"w\xn[\v[5]]We'll break the ice soon enough! She at least seems to respect my battle prowess, which I'm happy about."O\xn[\v[5]]\PN, are you coming with us to Zimbani City? I'll see you there!"~\xn[\v[5]]Diana and I just arrived at Zimbani City. A lot happened and... Well, it's better if I just tell you in person."S\xn[\v[5]]You're still in Zimbani, right? I'm there as well, so let's meet up!"V\xn[\v[5]]Diana and I are investigating the Dragon Tomb together. It's so spooky!"S\xn[\v[5]]What are you doing, \PN? Did you receive the Zimbani City badge yet?"R\xn[\v[5]]... No? You need to speak to the old Gym Leader Benjamin to get it?"Y\xn[\v[5]]I heard his family is pretty rich. They must live in a pretty big house..."H\xn[\v[5]]I hope you can get that badge! You deserve it, after all!"T\xn[\v[5]]Diana and I are waiting at Zimbani Port. Are you coming with us, \PN?"W\xn[\v[5]]We've been invited to go to Sol Island, since we're all Gym Challengers."V\xn[\v[5]]We'll be among the first ones to see Team Sol's new base of operations."-\xn[\v[5]]Let's get this over with, \PN."A\xn[\v[5]]Sol Island... Just what has Team Sol done with it?"J\xn[\v[5]]They've perverted a historical location in their own image."W\xn[\v[5]]Well, we've been invited to check it out... Let's get it over with, \PN."2\xn[\v[5]]Diana and I just finished our tour.">\xn[\v[5]]We were invited to meet with Team Sol's leader."O\xn[\v[5]]His office is such a long way up... Are you coming with us, \PN?"A\xn[\v[5]]By the way, did you hear that annoucement earlier?":\xn[\v[5]]Seems like something went horribly wrong..."Q\xn[\v[5]]Something about a subject escaping convinement and wrecking havoc?"c\xn[\v[5]]Anyway, I'm keeping you aren't I... We'll wait for you at the Team Sol boss' office."B\xn[\v[5]]I can't believe Team Sol captured the Elite Four..."_\xn[\v[5]]Those mythical Pok√©mon should be free to protect the land, not experimented on!"0\xn[\v[5]]We can still stop them, at least."j\xn[\v[5]]If we can learn more about them at the Jyeshtha Library, we can intercept Team Sol's plans."g\xn[\v[5]]Me, you, Diana... We're all working together now to stop Team Sol! So... to the library!"f\xn[\v[5]]Team Sol is planning on trying to become the Solar Monarch by participating in the SCT."a\xn[\v[5]]In the meantime, they're also working on trying to obtain Cobalion and Solgaleo..."v\xn[\v[5]]We can't let that happen, \PN! So, let's keep collecting the Gym Badges and then head to Arcadia Ruins."R\xn[\v[5]]We're going to need to work together to get back up to the surface."P\xn[\v[5]]It's so frustrating that Team Sol used Solarium on the Apostle..."*\xn[\v[5]]Come on, let's do our best!":\xn[\v[5]]We managed to calm down The Apostle, but..."`\xn[\v[5]]Team Sol is closing in on their goals. We need to head north to protect Cobalion."q\xn[\v[5]]There, we can get our 6th Gym Badge as well. So let's head to Route 16 and discuss strategy there."_\xn[\v[5]]Diana and I are investigating Praestia Cavern. How are things going on your end?"`\xn[\v[5]]It'd be best if you challenged the gym and see if the Gym Leader knows something."a\xn[\v[5]]Mount Laplaenta is going to be a harsh climb... But you're more than capable, \PN."+\xn[\v[5]]Good luck, I believe in you!"T\xn[\v[5]]Diana told me that you found Cobalion and defended him from Team Sol."M\xn[\v[5]]I imagine Cobalion must be on his way here in Praestia Cavern."b\xn[\v[5]]The place is filled with illusions, even with Diana taking the lead it's difficult."C\xn[\v[5]]\PN, if you could help us we'd really appreciate it!"Q\xn[\v[5]]Sure! Which one of your friends did you want me to take a look at?"6\xn[\v[5]]Oh, you changed your mind? That's fine."C\xn[\v[5]]Seems like \v[3] has its heart closed shut to you..."[\xn[\v[5]]\v[3] looks almost frustrated with you... You're not getting along, are you?"i\xn[\v[5]]\v[3] seems pretty neutral on you. But that only means you can become even better friends!"`\xn[\v[5]]\v[3] seems happier when around you. I can tell that it's getting comfy with you!"u\xn[\v[5]]Wow! You and \v[3] seem so bright and cheerful together! I bet it must be a lot of fun being together!"i\xn[\v[5]]I can tell that \v[3] trusts you completely, \PN. How amazing to have such a close friend!"G\xn[\v[5]]If I had to gauge your bond, it'd be a \v[4] out of 100."V\xn[\v[5]]\PN, would you perhaps like me to say some encouraging things to \v[3]?"5\xn[\v[5]]Hey, \v[3]! Listen to me for a moment!"R\xn[\v[5]]... There! \v[3] should start to see your good side a bit more now!"(\xn[\v[5]]Oh, alright. That's fine."*\xn[\v[5]]Alright, talk to you later!"!\xn[\v[5]]Oh.

Talk to you later!"=\xn[\v[5]]Remember our conversation about our ambitions?"E\xn[\v[5]]It got me thinking. \PN, are you a dreamer or realist?"6\xn[\v[5]]You're more of a \v[1]? I can see that."+\xn[\v[5]]Huh, I'm the same, actually!"0\xn[\v[5]]Though, I'm a bit of a realist..."`\xn[\v[5]]I have plenty of dreams, but I wouldn't waste my time if they weren't achievable."B\xn[\v[5]]Keeping myself grounded is what keeps me sane, too."Z\xn[\v[5]]That being said, whatever dream you have, \PN... I know you can achieve it."-\xn[\v[5]]Right, I'll go study now. Bye!"U\xn[\v[5]]Have you gotten a chance to participate in the Zimbani Colosseum, \PN?"V\xn[\v[5]]I tried it once, it was super cool! It felt so fresh and new each time!"e\xn[\v[5]]I don't always get very far, but when I do I just feel like I'm the best in the world!"R\xn[\v[5]]... Of course, I'd feel even more like that if I heard it from you."8\xn[\v[5]]Hee-hee! I'm just teasing you...a little."V\xn[\v[5]]The point is, you should totally check it out! See how far you can get!"N\xn[\v[5]]Maybe I'll go do another run right now. Talk to you later, \PN!"G\xn[\v[5]]\PN, have you visited the Pok√©mon Guild in Biytea City?"H\xn[\v[5]]You can send your Pok√©mon away on adventures! It's neat!"J\xn[\v[5]]I sent some of mine once, and I got some pretty nice finds.";\xn[\v[5]]My Pok√©mon were rewarded nicely, of course!"E\xn[\v[5]]You should visit at some point if you haven't already!":\xn[\v[5]]Well, gotta run. Nice speaking to you, \PN!"]\xn[\v[5]]You know, besides being a Trainer, I really enjoy cooking and watching movies."q\xn[\v[5]]I especially love the movies from Pok√©star Studios. I'd love to visit that place myself, one day!"|\xn[\v[5]]Actually, I really enjoy traveling in general. I love seeing different cultures and meeting different people."R\xn[\v[5]]The world is so vast, you'll never know what or who you might find!"Q\xn[\v[5]]Do you have plans on traveling outside of the Solaria region, \PN?"^\xn[\v[5]]... Oops! Poken√©ct is about to run out of battery! I gotta run to a safe spot!"H\xn[\v[5]]I'm a Pok√©mon Trainer and training to be a nurse, but..."?\xn[\v[5]]Well, I'd love to try Pok√©mon Contests one day!"T\xn[\v[5]]Shame that they aren't popular in Solaria. There's so much out there."T\xn[\v[5]]I've traveled many places. I'm so grateful for all of my experiences."9\xn[\v[5]]Of course, that includes meeting you, \PN!"6\xn[\v[5]]...Oh, yikes! I just got into a battle!"%\xn[\v[5]]Let's talk later, \PN!";\xn[\v[5]]Say, \PN... What sort of movies do you like?"3\xn[\v[5]]... I see, so you like \v[1] movies?"H\xn[\v[5]]I'm actually a really big fan of Romance movies, as well."e\xn[\v[5]]Yeah, I love those kinds of movies, too! A lot of my favourite films are \v[1] movies."E\xn[\v[5]]But personally, my favourite genre are Romance movies."à\xn[\v[5]]There is just something special about two souls in such a large world, meeting by pure chance...and forming a bond together..."~\xn[\v[5]]And watching that bond grow into a lifelong friendship and watching that develop into an eternal partnership..."M\xn[\v[5]]... Sigh, I hope to find someone like that as well, one day..."<\xn[\v[5]]... Sorry. I was starting to space out there."1\xn[\v[5]]Thanks for the talk, \PN. Bye-bye!"L\xn[\v[5]]\PN, are you much of a movie watcher? Which ones do you like?")\xn[\v[5]]Oh, you like \v[1] movies?"G\xn[\v[5]]O-Oh. We're the same in that regard. Didn't expect that!"-\xn[\v[5]]\v[1] movies are really great!"3\xn[\v[5]]Though, uh... I love Romance movies."L\xn[\v[5]]I don't know what it is about them, but I enjoy them a lot..."M\xn[\v[5]]...Sorry, it's a bit embarrassing! I don't know why, though...""\xn[\v[5]]Love... seems nice."Q\xn[\v[5]]I guess you may or may not agree... but I'll leave that up to you."8\xn[\v[5]]That was interesting, at least. Bye, \PN!"p\xn[\v[5]]My friends were having a Pok√©mon battle the other day. It was nice to see them enjoy themselves."j\xn[\v[5]]They attracted a small crowd as well, even. Battles sure look different from the sidelines."h\xn[\v[5]]Then a little girl started crying, telling her mother that she wanted a Pok√©mon as well."9\xn[\v[5]]I told her to never give up on her dreams."5\xn[\v[5]]Just a few kind words goes a long way."I\xn[\v[5]]... Anyway, I think I should be on my way again. Bye, \PN!"_\xn[\v[5]]Recently, I was traveling in a remote area, without any Pok√©mon Centers nearby."R\xn[\v[5]]There was an injured Pok√©mon that a few people were worrying over."E\xn[\v[5]]The wounds seemed pretty bad. I tried my best to help."a\xn[\v[5]]Even though I'm a nurse for humans, my experience allows me to help Pok√©mon, too."=\xn[\v[5]]I hope that Pok√©mon has made a full recovery!"7\xn[\v[5]]Heh, look at the time. Bye for now, \PN."1\xn[\v[5]]\PN, what's your favourite season?"\xn[\v[5]]... \v[1], huh?"I\xn[\v[5]]I love Summer, as well! Feels like not a lot of people do!"P\xn[\v[5]]A lot of people complain about the heat, but it never bothers me."3\xn[\v[5]]I personally really like the Summer."W\xn[\v[5]]I know that people don't like the heat, but I'm personally not bothered."x\xn[\v[5]]It gives me a sense of nostalgia. It makes me think back to those lazy afternoons during summer vacation."F\xn[\v[5]]I'm also just a really big fan of ice cream, hee-hee..."C\xn[\v[5]]Maybe we can eat some ice cream together sometime..."I\xn[\v[5]]... Oh! I gotta go. A wild Pok√©mon suddenly jumped at me.".\xn[\v[5]]Talk to you soon, \PN. Bye-bye!"(\xn[\v[5]]... \v[1]... Interesting."7\xn[\v[5]]Yeah, me too! Autumn is the best season!"G\xn[\v[5]]It has the perfect balance of hot and cold. I love that!"'\xn[\v[5]]I love Autumn, actually."A\xn[\v[5]]The balance of warmth and coldness is just divine."Z\xn[\v[5]]When leaves turn warm colors, like red, yellow, and brown, it's... amazing."T\xn[\v[5]]As you can guess, Holtlant Town is a personal favorite place of mine."6\xn[\v[5]]Shall we visit there together, one day?"I\xn[\v[5]]Hehe. Think about it! For now, I need to get back to work."%\xn[\v[5]]Talk to you soon, \PN."V\xn[\v[5]]I heard that some Pok√©mon can look totally different in other regions."V\xn[\v[5]]For example... Raichu is totally different depending on where it lives."k\xn[\v[5]]Did you know that some regional variations of Dunsparce are actually incapable of evolution?"K\xn[\v[5]]Yes, I am quite the genius when it comes to Dunsparce facts."\\xn[\v[5]]For example... Did you know that Dunsparce are actually quite self-conscious?"C\xn[\v[5]]It's just so cute! They're just shy little beanbags."s\xn[\v[5]]I always make sure to pamper my Dunsparce lots and lots, to make sure that he knows that he's loved."z\xn[\v[5]]... Oops, it seems that Dunsparce overheard me and wants a bit of attention. Poor boy feels a bit left out."F\xn[\v[5]]Don't you think Ghost-type Pok√©mon are so fascinating?"Y\xn[\v[5]]I heard that there's many different types that live in the Solaria region."<\xn[\v[5]]That includes my favorite Ghost-type, Dreepy!"P\xn[\v[5]]Drakloak and Dragapult are winners in my book, too, but Dreepy..."\xn[\v[5]]It's adorable!"V\xn[\v[5]]Do you know that Dreepy love being catapulted out of Dragapult's horns?"M\xn[\v[5]]It's strange, sure, but seeing them having fun makes me smile!"G\xn[\v[5]]Speaking of which, I was gonna train my Dragapult today!"#\xn[\v[5]]Catch ya later, \PN!"=\xn[\v[5]]I love pink Pok√©mon! It's my favourite color."G\xn[\v[5]]We have a Stufful as a pet at home. She's very adorable!"X\xn[\v[5]]Whenever I see a pink Pok√©mon, I just have to resist the urge to pet it!"v\xn[\v[5]]I once fought a trainer that had a Flaaffy as his ace. I almost called off the battle entirely. Almost."0\xn[\v[5]]What's your favourite color, \PN?"L\xn[\v[5]]Ah, so you like \v[1]! Have you seen a lot of \v[1] Pok√©mon?"c\xn[\v[5]]You should totally show me a Pok√©mon that's \v[1] next time we see each other, \PN!"c\xn[\v[5]]... Oops! Gotta go. No, it's not a pink Pok√©mon. It's just more Rock-type Pok√©mon."\xn[\v[5]]Bye-bye, \PN."D\xn[\v[5]]My favourite color is green. It reminds me of nature!"8\xn[\v[5]]Dreepy is green, so that checks out, too."@\xn[\v[5]]I wear a lot of green. Maybe too much, in fact..."E\xn[\v[5]]You like \v[1]? Have you seen a lot of \v[1] Pok√©mon?"K\xn[\v[5]]Hey, why don't you show me a Pok√©mon that's \v[1] sometime!"C\xn[\v[5]]*THUD*\nOw. I just dropped my Pok√©nect on my chest."K\xn[\v[5]]Haha, that's a sign that I need to get out of bed. Bye, \PN!"^\xn[\v[5]]Time flies when I talk to you, \PN. You know what they say about time flying..."Q\xn[\v[5]]Hee-hee... It means that I'm having fun. I enjoy talking with you."k\xn[\v[5]]Feel free to give me a call and shower me with attention, I'll try to answer whenever I can."/\xn[\v[5]]Talk to you later, \PN. Bye-bye!"d\xn[\v[5]]We've had so many conversations lately, \PN... Do you ever get sick of talking to me?"T\xn[\v[5]]I don't get sick of talking to you. You're something special, haha..."O\xn[\v[5]]As long as I'm not annoying you, I'll continue to chat with you.")\xn[\v[5]]Right, gotta go. Bye, \PN!"V\xn[\v[5]]A friend asked me to help them catch Pok√©mon for their little brother."O\xn[\v[5]]What kind of Pok√©mon do you think I should catch for them, \PN?"Q\xn[\v[5]]... A \v[1]-type Pok√©mon? Yeah, maybe that could be a good one..."A\xn[\v[5]]I'll try and find a cute \v[1]-type for them then."K\xn[\v[5]]Thanks for the advice, \PN. I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye!"H\xn[\v[5]]Hey, so, I got asked this recently, and I was wondering.."M\xn[\v[5]]What kind of Pok√©mon do you think everyone should catch, \PN?"D\xn[\v[5]]... A \v[1]-type Pok√©mon? Yeah, I definitely see it!"J\xn[\v[5]]Thanks for the advice, \PN. I'll talk to you later. See ya!"\xn[\v[5]]Hey, \PN...?"P\xn[\v[5]]I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but... I just need your help."S\xn[\v[5]]I had an argument with my dad yesterday... Things got pretty heated."_\xn[\v[5]]Looking back, it feels so petty. I feel bad and want to make things up to him..."[\xn[\v[5]]... Yeah, I'll just be honest and apologize to him. I'll try and be sincere."5\xn[\v[5]]Thanks, \PN. You really cheered me up."/\xn[\v[5]]I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye."\xn[\v[5]]You up, \PN?"L\xn[\v[5]]I'm... uh... training to be a nurse... it's really hard work."R\xn[\v[5]]I keep feeling like I'm not enough. Like it's never gonna work out."c\xn[\v[5]]But I want to stop feeling like this. Because I know, deep down, I want this. A lot."X\xn[\v[5]]... Ah, you're right. I've come so far, I might as well see this through."F\xn[\v[5]]Thanks, \PN. Hearing your words helps give me strength."2\xn[\v[5]]I'm gonna rest for a bit. Bye, \PN."V\xn[\v[5]]So, \PN... What would you say is something that you work extra hard at?"O\xn[\v[5]]\v[1]? That's fair. I'd consider that pretty important, as well."E\xn[\v[5]]I actually want to work hard on my popularity as well."d\xn[\v[5]]Personally... Don't judge me for this, but... I'd want to work hard on my popularity."K\xn[\v[5]]I don't know how to explain it... I just want to be someone."m\xn[\v[5]]I know I'm already someone, yeah... But I want to feel like what I'm doing matters, I suppose."ã\xn[\v[5]]To have people recognize what I'm doing. Instead of just being...another face, I guess. Just forgotten about as soon as I'm gone."\xn[\v[5]]..."M\xn[\v[5]]...Really? I'm glad that you care, \PN. It really means a lot."R\xn[\v[5]]This got a bit heavy, hehe... I'll talk to you later, \PN. Bye-bye."G\xn[\v[5]]Hey, \PN! What's something that you work really hard at?"\xn[\v[5]]\v[1]? I see..."@\xn[\v[5]]Hahaha, same. I'm working hard on my career, too."@\xn[\v[5]]I'm actually working hard on my career right now."Q\xn[\v[5]]Of course, relationships are important. But right now, you know..."`\xn[\v[5]]My nurse training... it's what I'm working hard at. And one day, I'll be a nurse."m\xn[\v[5]]I'll have the responsibility to look after people and make sure that they are being cared for."$\xn[\v[5]]Isn't that something?"@\xn[\v[5]]...I really appreciate your support, \PN. Always."2\xn[\v[5]]Look after yourself, too, \PN. Bye."/\xn[\v[5]]Hey, I thought of something fun!"L\xn[\v[5]]Let's send each other a goofy photo, of us with our Pok√©mon!"7\xn[\v[5]]... You will? Great! Give me a moment..."T\xn[\v[5]]Aww, you and \v[1] look great together! I love the pose you're doing."p\xn[\v[5]]What do you think of Dunsparce and I? I really tried to capture my inner-Dunsparce in this photo."W\xn[\v[5]]I bet you can't even tell who is who, hee-hee. I am quite the performer."F\xn[\v[5]]That was fun, \PN. We should do it again at some point."\xn[\v[5]]Bye-bye!"$\xn[\v[5]]So, I was thinking..."F\xn[\v[5]]I'm gonna send you a pic of me with one of my Pok√©mon."&\xn[\v[5]]Will you send one back?"/\xn[\v[5]]...Yeah, awesome! Let's do this!"L\xn[\v[5]]\PN, you and \v[1] look great together! You match each other!"W\xn[\v[5]]I tried to look cool, but Dragapult ended up being the star of the show."I\xn[\v[5]]Quite frankly, I'll never be as cool as Dragapult. Hahaha!"\xn[\v[5]]See ya!"6\xn[\v[5]]Heeey, \PN... Can I ask you a question?"R\xn[\v[5]]What do you prefer? Do you care more about appearance or substance?"B\xn[\v[5]]... I see, I see... \v[1] is important to you, huh?"c\xn[\v[5]]I feel the same. I care a lot more about someone's character rather than appearance."Q\xn[\v[5]]... Well, of course appearance is also something I look at, but..."}\xn[\v[5]]I care more about learning what someone is actually like, rather than purely focus on what someone looks like."A\xn[\v[5]]Hee-hee... So, what do you think of my appearance?"v\xn[\v[5]]I'll have to make sure to put a bit more effort into my appearance then, if that's what you care about."E\xn[\v[5]]Anyway, I gotta go for now! A Trainer just spotted me."+\xn[\v[5]]\PN, something on my mind..."S\xn[\v[5]]What do you prefer? Do you care more about appearance ofr substance?"c\xn[\v[5]]IYeah. The outside may be pretty, but if there's nothing inside... what's the point?"M\xn[\v[5]]No one is truly ugly on the outside. That's what I believe in."[\xn[\v[5]]But they can be ugly on the inside. It may seem harsh, but that's the truth."7\xn[\v[5]]Hey, what do you think of my appearance?"*\xn[\v[5]]I'm quite hot, I know. Heh."@\xn[\v[5]]Alright, enough of this. I'm gonna go for a swim!"\\xn[\v[5]]...So, \PN... I hope this won't be bothersome, but I have another question..."Z\xn[\v[5]]... What do you prefer to see in people? What sort of traits do you desire?"<\xn[\v[5]]...Aha, so you respect \v[1] people the most?")\xn[\v[5]]I prefer kind people, too."(\xn[\v[5]]I prefer seeing kindness."d\xn[\v[5]]Some people might say that it's a bit boring, but I just prefer someone that is kind."^\xn[\v[5]]It takes strength to be kind and gentle. That's a sign of a truly great person.".\xn[\v[5]]I'll try to always remain kind."A\xn[\v[5]]Anyway, thanks for chatting with me, \PN. Bye-bye!"Q\xn[\v[5]]I know I've asked a lot of questions lately, but I have another..."X\xn[\v[5]]... What do you prefer to see in people? What sort of traits do you like?";\xn[\v[5]]I take it you respect \v[1] people the most?"$\xn[\v[5]]I love kind people..."O\xn[\v[5]]A kind heart... can you believe that some people don't have one?"`\xn[\v[5]]You can be nice to others on a shallow level. But it sometimes kindness can hurt.">\xn[\v[5]]Knowing that, choosing to be kind is important."6\xn[\v[5]]Anyway, thanks for the chat today, \PN!"Y\xn[\v[5]]The other day I encountered this guy and he said the weirdest thing to me."?\xn[\v[5]]He told me to listen closely and then told me..."\xn[\v[5]]"SOCIALIZER"."^\xn[\v[5]]They then told me to tell the password to the fancy guy at the Pok√©mon Center."l\xn[\v[5]]I haven't done it yet. Honestly, I actually forgot it even happened until we started talking."U\xn[\v[5]]Let's see what happens if we tell that guy the password. "SOCIALIZER"."E\xn[\v[5]]Hey! \PN! Some guy just said the weirdest thing to me."V\xn[\v[5]]Then, I was told to say that to the strange man at the Pok√©mon Center."E\xn[\v[5]]I just had to tell you, because of how strange it was."3\xn[\v[5]]Haha, anyway... catch ya later, \PN!"5\xn[\v[5]]Um...

I'm not trying to impress anyone!"N\xn[\v[5]]Plus, I'm normally hot and sweaty, anyway. Who would want that?"R\xn[\v[5]]... Some people would? Okay... I don't know how to respond to that."0\xn[\v[5]]Gotta get back to work. Bye, \PN!"F\xn[\v[5]]So... Um... \PN, maybe this is a weird question, but..."Y\xn[\v[5]]What sort of people do you like?

Come one, I said stop it!"6\xn[\v[5]]Sigh... You really want attention, huh."f\xn[\v[5]]Sorry, \PN. I'll have to cut it short. Dunsparce really wants some attention right now."!\xn[\v[5]]Draga!!

It helps with bonding, and stuff."N\xn[Lairus]Seems cozy enough, I suppose. But I'm glad I have my own room."q\xn[Lairus]This is where grunts do grunt work. Y'know, fill in documents and keep tracks of certain numbers."R\xn[Lairus]It's grunt work! But I guess it's still important, or something..."{\xn[Lairus]Honestly, every time I come here I just see new faces. Team Sol must hire a lot of people for this kind of work."J\xn[Lairus]Hey, that's great, right? Means more jobs for more people!"ü\xn[Lairus]I know that you're a trainer and all, so you probably don't care about this stuff right now... But perhaps in the future, you can work here as well!"r\xn[Lairus]This is the lobby for the artificial gardens. We can take the teleporters to go to different labs."L\xn[Lairus]Yeah, we got teleporters. I know, it's pretty awesome stuff."j\xn[Lairus]This place seem familiar to you? Yeah, it's all modelled after the the forests of Solaria."|\xn[Lairus]Anyway, our team do a bunch of cool stuff in here. Pok√©mon can chill out in their natural habitats. That's neat."d\xn[Lairus]Eh, whatever. Not that someone like you would care, right? Let's just get a move on."]\xn[Lairus]This place seem familiar to you? Yeah, it's all modelled after Malum Volcano."É\xn[Lairus]How they get the lava that hot without burning the whole lab down, I have no clue. And I'm not here to find out, either."ô\xn[Lairus]Speaking of which, you handled the heat back then pretty well. Battling beside bubbling hot lava... now that was a thrill I won't soon forget."`\xn[Lairus]Not that I'd like to be stuck in here. My job's cool 'cause I get to go outside."`\xn[Lairus]This place seem familiar to you? Yeah, it's all modelled after the Solarian sea."F\xn[Lairus]I think this is the research lab that Sienna works in."]\xn[Lairus]I figured it would be best to visit when everyone's done. So let's get going."e\xn[Lairus]However... I'm gonna go on ahead. Gotta make sure nothing's gonna go wrong, you know?"\xn[Lairus]Later."g\xn[Lairus]... But it might be best to go here last. I don't really feel like going here just yet."W\xn[Lairus]Yeah, I'm technically the one in charge of the tour so my say is final!"n\xn[Lairus]You know, I could get used to bossing you around. Don't you feel the same way? Now get moving!"V\xn[Lairus]This is our lord's chambers. Or at least, the hallway to his chambers."j\xn[Lairus]He'll be super... err... disappointed in us, if we disturb him now. So, let's not do that."C\xn[Lairus]Come on, turn around and get back in that elevator!"\xn[Lairus]Anyway..."2\xn[Lairus]This tour has gone on long enough."^\xn[Lairus]It's time I decide where we go and I say we're gonna visit the laboratory now!"f\xn[Sienna]This is the main lobby. You can find the reception here, as well as a Pok√©mon Center."\xn[Sienna]..."(\xn[Sienna]This is the medical bay."f\xn[Sienna]Our work can sometimes get people injured, but we make sure to take good care of them."^\xn[Sienna]I like that we have reliable healthcare workers here in case anyone gets hurt."\\xn[Sienna]They're all very good at what they do. Not to mention, it's completely free."g\xn[Sienna]The staff are paid well and the hours are very flexible... They seem satisified, to me."i\xn[Sienna]I don't frequent this place often. Neither me nor my Pok√©mon ever get seriously injured."O\xn[Sienna]...I fear that I may have digressed a little. Shall we move on?"r\xn[Sienna]We have the dorms here. High-ranking officers get the top rooms. The Grunts share the lower rooms."]\xn[Sienna]I don't like sharing a room with others. But you would have to if you joined."q\xn[Sienna]I have my own room, as I am a Team Sol admin. I spend my nights reading scientific papers online."A\xn[Sienna]...I was just thinking. \PN, do you have a dream?"è\xn[Sienna]For some reason, I can't read the look on your face. But back when I first met you, there was one thing I did feel, though: resolve."D\xn[Sienna]It makes me wonder if there's anything you dream of."!\xn[Sienna]... My own dream?"^\xn[Sienna]I have many. I appreciate that you ask but I will keep them to myself for now."=\xn[Sienna]Let's not drag our heels and proceed onwards."[\xn[Sienna]This is Aelia's room. I don't have much to say, as I don't spend time here."[\xn[Sienna]This is Lairus' room. I don't have much to say, as I don't spend time here."b\xn[Sienna]This is my room. As you can see, I have tweaked it based on my personal interests."ë\xn[Sienna]Even as I retreat here for the night, I often find myself working on things anyway. That is why I can keep track of things, even here."µ\xn[Sienna]My laptop is quite powerful. It is the most powerful laptop I've ever owned in my life. It is able to run quite a lot of high-end software and store a lot of information."®\xn[Sienna]You might assume that I am referring to video games, but I do not play those. I prefer to spend my time researching and working on personal projects instead."x\xn[Sienna]If you were to inspect my computer, you'd see a lot of documents that I assume would fly over your head."{\xn[Sienna]... That is, if you ever figure out my login details. I receive many comments on the length of my password.">\xn[Sienna]These rooms are shared among groups of grunts."E\xn[Sienna]I don't like sharing my room. I'm glad I have my own."~\xn[Sienna]This is the office where more mundane work is done, such as keeping tracks of statistics and filling out paperwork."p\xn[Sienna]These also happen to be the entry-level jobs, so it is also the biggest section of the building."\xn[Sienna]Although, it is also the most boring and mundane. I prefer the science labs, which you might have already guessed..."y\xn[Sienna]This is the lobby to the artificial habitats. We can use the teleporters to go to the different habitats."`\xn[Sienna]Is it nice here? This research garden is based on the forest regions of Solaria."|\xn[Sienna]The breeze feels almost real. This area is highly controlled to ensure the plant life will thrive here 24/7."L\xn[Sienna]The grass Pok√©mon we keep here seem happy. To me, at least."`\xn[Sienna]It's a shame that I don't work in this lab. Mine is rather dreary in comparison."^\xn[Sienna]Is it nice here? This research garden is based on the Malum region of Solaria."©\xn[Sienna]The lava is not actual lava, though it shares enough characteristics to basically be the same. There is no danger in it destroying this research lab, however."•\xn[Sienna]The Pok√©mon here live just like they would out in the wild. I wonder if they can even notice the difference. Do they realize that this is all artificial?"x\xn[Sienna]It's nice in here. Sometimes it makes me think that I'm the only one left on this planet. It's soothing."y\xn[Sienna]But at the end of the day, it's all man-made. We made this to replicate the waters that Pok√©mon live in."g\xn[Sienna]Do you like it? If you look close enough, you can see the Pok√©mon swimming underwater."C\xn[Sienna]I decided that this one would be best visited last."-\xn[Sienna]Come. Let's go deeper inside."q\xn[Sienna]I will go on ahead. It is important to make sure that everything is ready, so I will handle that."N\xn[Sienna]This is the lab. However, it is not ready yet for us to visit.")\xn[Sienna]I ask that you turn back."A\xn[Sienna]The lord's chambers are off-limits for this tour."\xn[Sienna]That aside..."P\xn[Sienna]Shall we get moving?

At this stage, it can only harden, so it remains motionless to avoid attack."hIt collects honey every day. It rubs honey onto the hairs on its legs to carry it back to its nest."fIts poison stinger is very powerful.

Despite popularity, they are quite rare."eIf its electric pouches run empty, it raises its tail to gather electricity from the atmosphere."òIt burrows into the ground to create its nest. If hard stones impede its tunneling, it uses its sharp claws to shatter them and then carries on digging."îIt climbs trees by hooking on with its sharp claws.

The spines will never secrete poison while young are present."ÑThe horn on a male Nidoran's forehead contains a powerful poison. This is a very cautious Pok√©mon, always straining its large ears."áIt's nervous and quick to act aggressively. The potency of its poison increases along with the level of adrenaline present in its body."WOne swing of its mighty tail can snap a telephone pole as if it were a matchstick."lIt is said that happiness will come to those who see a gathering of Clefairy dancing under a full moon."xTheir ears are sensitive enough to hear a pin drop from over a mile away, so they're usually found in quiet places."óWhile young, it has six gorgeous tails. When it grows, several new tails are sprouted. The amount of tails it has shows how much psychic energy it has."ÜVery smart and very vengeful. Grabbing one of its many tails could result in a 1,000-year curse. It once cursed a human into a Gengar."çJigglypuff has top-notch lung capacity, even by comparison to other Pok√©mon.

Extremely hostile towards humans and will attack on-sight."iDuring the day, it stays in the cold underground to avoid the sun. It grows by bathing in moonlight."qIts pistils exude an incredibly foul odor. The horrid stench can cause fainting at a distance of 1.25 miles."kIt has the world's largest petals. With every step, the petals shake out heavy clouds of toxic pollen."lBurrows under the ground to gnaw on tree roots. The mushrooms on its back absorb most of the nutrition."]The larger the mushroom on its back grows, the stronger the mushroom spores it scatters."^Lives in the shadows of tall trees where it eats bugs. It is attracted by light at night."lThe wings are covered with dustlike scales. Every time it flaps its wings, it looses highly toxic dust."rIt burrows through the ground at a shallow depth.
